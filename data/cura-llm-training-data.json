Now that you have selected your planet or moon, let's look at how we are going to get there!&nbsp;    Travelling to new planets or moons takes a long time and involves moving at an incredible speed. This, of course, leads us to rockets.&nbsp;    To get a rocket into space, you must understand how the laws of physics and other forces affect rocket flight. Without this knowledge, you cannot design a rocket to reach the speeds and heights necessary to enter orbit.&nbsp;   &nbsp;    How do rockets work?      Newton’s Laws of Motion     The rocket launching experiment we will do later (using a film canister as our rocket) is an example of Newton’s Third Law of Motion – “ Every action has an equal and opposite reaction ”. The gas rushing out of one end of the canister (the action) causes the rocket to move in the opposite direction (the reaction). Just like what happens when you let the air out of a balloon!       Newton's Third Law &amp; Balloons       This is exactly how all rockets work - whether you use baking soda and vinegar as your fuel or a chemical rocket propellant like they do at NASA.     How do the NASA rockets work?     These rockets use a pressurized fuel and an oxidizer. The oxidizer is something that allows the fuel to burn without using outside air. The fuel, in a gaseous state, is pressurized because this forces it out the end of the rocket just like our film canister rocket! However, there are a few more parts to an actual rocket.    NASA rockets use  liquid hydrogen  as the fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. The fuel and oxidizer are only in these liquid states when they are in the holding tanks and they can only stay in this liquid state at extremely low temperatures. The fuel and oxidizer are allowed to combine within the combustion chamber and, as they burn, they turn into a gas (gases take up about 1,000 times more space than a liquid).&nbsp;    This causes the intense pressure and is exactly like our film canister rocket. The carbon dioxide builds up and puts intense pressure on the canister so the lid pops off. In the case of our rocket, the fuel and oxidizer burn, are put under intense pressure, and are released through chutes at the bottom of the rocket. This propels the rocket upwards.       Rocket Science: A Short Explanation         Rocket fuel experiment     Getting the fuel ratios right is a vital part of a successful rocket launch. You are going to try and find the most powerful combination of fuel to launch your rocket.    In this experiment, we are going to use baking soda and vinegar to launch our rockets. Baking soda and vinegar react to form carbon dioxide - a gas. When this reaction occurs in a film canister, the gas builds up until it can no longer be contained and the base of the canister shoots off.     Aim     To investigate the most effective fuel combination to launch a rocket     Materials         35 mm film canister with internal snapping lid (clear Fuji ones work the best)    Timer      Water &amp; vinegar    Metre ruler or tape measure      Baking soda    Chalk      Waxed paper or bowl    Paper towel      Measuring spoons    Protective clothing and safety glasses         Method      Place 1 teaspoon of baking soda onto the waxed paper or bowl. Add 1\/8 tsp of water to the baking soda and mix it in well. If you are using waxed paper, carefully use the wax paper to fold the damp baking soda onto itself to help mix in the water    Turn the film canister lid upside-down and pack the inside of the depression with the damp baking soda. (Do not put baking soda where the canister snaps onto the lid.) Pack it tightly&nbsp;    Turn the lid right side-up again for a moment. Does the damp baking soda stay in place? If it stays, move to the next step. If the baking soda falls out, then add a little bit more water to the baking soda and mix it in, but try to add as little water as needed. The baking soda will not need to stay in the lid long    Add 5 tsp of vinegar (1 tsp at a time) to the canister at a time, filling it almost to the top. You need to add as much vinegar to the canister as possible without the vinegar and the baking soda coming into contact when you later snap the lid onto the canister    Go outside to an open area at least three metres from buildings. If possible, find a nearby wall and, using the chalk and metre ruler or tape measure, mark out 50 cm heights (to about two metres high) on the wall    Bend down near the ground on a flat, hard spot and quickly snap the lid onto the canister to seal it. Immediately turn the canister over, so the lid is on the ground, and quickly move away. The other members of the group should start timing and recording while this happens. Wait for the chemical reaction to occur    Stop timing and filming when your rockets comes back down to the ground. Record your results in your results table    Tip: If the rocket did not launch, the lid might not have been sealed tightly enough. (If this happens you may simply see many bubbles coming out of the canister). The rocket may not have launched right for another reason (such as not sealing the lid fast enough). If it did not launch right, try preparing and launching the canister rocket again. You may need a little practice to get used to launching the rocket    Carefully rinse out the lid and canister with water and then dry them    Prepare the damp baking soda and vinegar again but this time use 3 tsp of vinegar    Launch your newly prepared canister rocket as you did in Step 6. Record your results    Rinse the lid and canister with water, dry them, and prepare them as before but this time use 1 tsp of vinegar    Launch the canister rocket. How long does it take to launch compared to the other two launches? How high does the canister go compared to the previous two times?    If you are unsure of any of your results, you can try repeating them (using the same amount of baking soda and vinegar)     Before you start the experiment, predict which fuel combination will be the most effective\/powerful. Why?   5 tsp of vinegar  3 tsp of vinegar  1 tsp of vinegar    Which fuel combination worked the best? Why? Was your prediction correct? &nbsp;   Why do you think the NASA scientists need to be very precise with the amount of fuel they have on board the rocket before take-off? "

The shorter the wavelength, the more it bends. Lights of different colours have different wavelengths, so each colour is refracted by different amounts. Therefore, white visible light is split up after passing from air to water and the individual colours become visible.&nbsp;    This scattering of light allows us to see the spectrum of colours that form a rainbow.       How Rainbows Form       We will be looking more at how refraction works more later on.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To split white visible light into its colours     Materials         Glass    Water      Sunlight or a small torch (not an LED light)    1 x A3\/A4 paper      Access to a darkened space   &nbsp;        Method      Fill the glass almost to the top with water    If you are using a torch, place the glass of water on the white piece of paper, and move the torch around until you see a rainbow on the piece of paper    If you are using sunlight, place the glass so that the sun shines directly through the water, onto a sheet of white paper underneath it or on the floor if it is on a table    Adjust the paper and the glass until a rainbow forms on the paper    Try holding the glass of water at different heights and angles to see if it has a different effect     Draw how you made your rainbow appear.

		"task_content" : "How do we recycle paper?    How paper is made    Paper is made when wood fibres are turned into pulp. The pulp is mixed with water, flattened, dried, and then cut into sheets. These sheets can be whitened, coloured, or made glossy, depending on the type of paper that is being created.      How Paper is Made      Recycled paper is made using the same process. But instead of using wood fibres from newly-logged trees, the fibre from old paper is used to make new paper.    Source: Suez Worldwide (2020) - ‘Paper &amp; Cardboard Recycling’.  Published online at suez.com.au . Retrieved from https:\/\/www.suez.com.au\/en-au\/sustainability-tips\/learn-about-waste-streams\/general-waste-streams\/paper-and-cardboard-recycling   &nbsp;  However, we can't recycle paper forever. That's because the  fibres  which paper is made of get shorter and shorter each time it is recycled. After paper has been recycled about 6-8 times, the fibres in that recycled paper are so short that they can't thread together with other paper fibres to create a new sheet of paper. If you tried to make paper using these fibres, the paper would have holes in it or would tear very easily.  &nbsp;    Create your own recycled paper    Factories that create recycled paper have very complex (and very expensive!) machinery to create recycled paper that looks as good as new. But we can still create our own recycled paper using a simple version of the same process!    Aim     To recycle paper     Materials         1-ply toilet paper    Newspaper or paper towel      Small or medium bowl    Large rectangular cake tin\/tray      Fork &amp; rolling pin    Piece of rectangular mesh (smaller than the inside of the cake tin) OR wire coat hanger and an old stocking      Warm water         Method     Cover your table with newspaper  Fill a small bowl with warm water  Tear the toilet paper up into tiny pieces and drop them into the water  Beat the mixture with a fork until the paper breaks down into fibres. If the mixture is too watery, tear up some more toilet paper and add it to your mixture  Place the mesh at the bottom of the cake pan\/container. Ensure that the mesh goes right to the edges of the pan and that the edges come up the sides (so you can pick it up by the edges in Step 7)  Pour the mixture into the cake pan  Grab the edges of the wire mesh and pull it up straight after pouring the mixture in. The water will drain through the mesh into the cake pan and the paper mulch should now be sitting on top of the mesh  Once the water stops dripping, place the mesh screen on the newspaper  Knead the paper flat until it is solid and dry  Roll the paper with a rolling pin  Leave the paper to dry    Summarise and explain how we can create new paper from recycled paper. How can we create a new paper sheet when recycled paper is torn and shredded?   Paper fibres need to be long to mesh together to form paper. When you wet and pulp paper during the recycling process, you shorten the paper fibres.  Use this information to explain why paper can only be recycled about 6-8 times.   Is paper recycling a reversible or an irreversible change? Why? "

		"task_title" : "Shadows",
		"task_content" : "Shadows    Light &amp; shadow     Shadows are made by blocking light. Light rays travel from a source, like the sun, in straight lines. If a solid (opaque) object gets in the way, it stops light rays from travelling through it. This results in an area of darkness appearing behind the object. The dark area is called a shadow.&nbsp;    Sunlight that travels towards the Earth takes just over 8 minutes to reach us. It travels at nearly 300,000 kilometres per second! When the rays reach Earth, they hit whatever is in their path. If the object they hit is opaque, the light cannot pass through, and a shadow forms.&nbsp;    This is why the Norwegian town of  Rjukan  is in darkness for six months of the year - the light rays from the sun hit the mountain before they reach the town.    It is easy to see shadows on bright, sunny days outside - objects such as trees, buildings and people form shadows in these conditions. But shadows also appear indoors due to artificial light.&nbsp;         Sundials     Humans first began using shadows to help tell the time of day thousands of years ago. They do this using  sundials . The oldest known  sundial  was made by the Ancient Egyptians and dates back to 1500 BCE.&nbsp;    A sundial used the shadows cast by the sun to tell the time of day. A dial would be placed in the centre of a circle with markings around the edge, indicating times of the day. As the Sun changes relative positions in the sky over the day, the position of the shadow cast by the dial changes to align with the different times around the outside of the circular plate. This way you can tell the time by looking at where the shadow is cast, using the markings around the edge of the circle.       How Sundials Use the Sun and Shadows to Tell the Time       The shadows cast by the sun change throughout the day and throughout the year as the sun's position in the sky also changes. This is why the town of  Rjukan  is only in darkness for six months, not for the whole year. In spring anmd summer, the position of the Sun has changed - so the Sun's rays hit the town instead of being blocked by the mountain.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To investigate shadows by making a human sundial     Materials         Open space with concrete or another hard surface    A clock      Chalk    Tape measure         Method      You need a clear, sunny day for this experiment. Check the weather forecast first!    Go to your open area where you can mark your sundial. You will need to visit it at least four times during the day so it needs to be nearby    Draw a small circle (or make an X) on the ground to mark where your partner will stand each time you measure their shadow. It’s important to stand in the same place each time to get accurate measurements    Early in the day (possibly 9:00 AM or 10:00 AM), have your partner stand on the marked spot. Your partner can also raise their arms up and clasped them above their head so they are like the hour hand on a clock    Trace your partner’s shadow using sidewalk chalk &amp; write the time next to it    Measure the length of your partner’s shadow and record it in your results table    Measure the distance from the last shadow    Record the direction that the shadow has moved from the last shadow by noting the path of the sun. (HINT: the sun rises in the east and sets in the west)    Come back at regular intervals throughout the day &amp; trace your shadow again, noting the time next to each tracing. You may want to&nbsp; check every hour but you could also do every 2-3 hours if you want. For example, if you make your first measurement at 9:00 AM, your next three could be at 11:00 AM, 1:00 PM, &amp; 3:00 PM     In general, how many centimetres does the shadow move between tracings? What direction does the shadow move across the day?   What is the relationship between the sun and your shadow? How did your shadow change throughout the day?   Create a line graph based on the change in the length of your shadows. You can do this digitally or by hand. Save a copy of it here.  Your graph will need to have the length of the shadow on the Y axis and the times that your shadow was measured on the X axis. You must include an accurate title for your graph (what is it showing?), appropriate and accurate scales for each of the axes, accurate plotting of your data, and labels for each axis   At what time of the day was the shadow at its shortest? At its longest? What affects the length of the shadow? "

In some cases, restoration and preservation is a never-ending process.  &nbsp;    Threats to ancient sites     Weather    What are the threats?&nbsp;   Most damage to ancient sites comes from exposure to the elements over a long period of time.

And extreme weather events like storms or floods might destroy a site completely.   How can we protect sites from these threats? &nbsp;  We usually can't cover an entire ancient site, so erosion from common weather events will happen. But some more fragile sections of a site - and any artefacts - can be covered or placed in a more sealed environment, such as a display room or a display case.

For example, when white light shines on a red object, all of the colours that form the white light are absorbed except red, which is reflected. This is why the object we see appears red.

For example, water is liquid at room temperature but turns into ice - a solid&nbsp;- when the temperature is lowered below water's freezing point. And if you add enough heat, water turns into water vapour and steam when it boils - both of which are gases.

The energy causes the atoms in the matter to vibrate faster or slower, depending on whether they are being heated (gaining more energy) or cooled (losing energy).&nbsp;    When enough heat is added, the atoms vibrate so fast that they break free of their bonds and move around more freely. This is why a solid can turn into a liquid, or a liquid into a gas. The opposite happens when the matter is cooled - the atoms vibrate more slowly and become more locked together, turning from a gas into a liquid or a liquid into a solid.       Changes      of State in Matter     There are four main changes in state:     Freezing : when a liquid turns into a solid     Melting : when a solid turns into a liquid     Evaporation : when a liquid turns into a gas. This might also be called  vapourisation  if this change in state occurs above the liquid's boiling point    Condensation : when a gas or vapour turns into a liquid   There are two less common changes in state which we won't explore:     Sublimation : when a solid turns straight into a gas, without turning into a liquid first     Deposition : when a gas turns straight into a solid, without turning into a liquid first    &nbsp;     &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To demonstrate under what conditions water changes its state of matter     Materials         Water    Metal tray      Ice cubes    Oven glove      Electric kettle   &nbsp;        Method      Pass around ice cubes amongst students.

		"task_content" : "Ostracism in Ancient Greece    Using primary and secondary sources    We often use a combination of primary and secondary sources when we are learning about history. This helps us make sense of a contemporary account whilst also using a later analysis to fill in gaps in our understanding.  In this task, we will look at the democratic process of  ostracising  a citizen from Athens.  Ostracism  was a process where members of society could vote to have a citizen exiled from Athens for 10 years. It was used to make sure tyrants could not control the city, and to stop threats to the State which citizens feared.  Let’s quickly learn a little more about what ostracism was from a  secondary source . This is a secondary source because Plutarch - though an ancient Greek philosopher and historian - was writing about this event at a later time (and not as a witness).   Source 1 (secondary source)    “The method of procedure - to give a general outline - was as follows. Each voter took an ostrakon, wrote on it the name of that citizen whom he wished to remove from the city, and brought it to a place in the agora which was all fenced about with railings. The archons first counted the total number of ostraka cast. For if the voters were less than six thousand, the ostracism was void. Then they separated the names, and the man who had received the most votes they proclaimed banished for ten years, with the right to enjoy the income from his property.\"  Plutarch, Plutarch's Lives, trans. Bernadotte Perrin (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1914), 2.   In this source:     Ostrakon \/ Ostraka (plural ) = small piece(s) of pottery     Agora  = central public space     Archons  = chief members of council     How would your conclusions about ostracism be different if you had only examined Source 1 (a secondary source) and not Source 2 (secondary) &amp; Sources 3 &amp; 4 (primary sources)?   Write two short sentences summarising what Source 1 tells us about ostracism   What do these sources not tell you about ostracism?   Combining evidence from all the sources, what do they tell you about ostracism? "

But preserving ancient sites is not always an easy task. Many sites are extremely fragile. Some are exposed to wild weather or are suffering from the number of visitors that they receive. In some cases, restoration and preservation is a never-ending process.  &nbsp;    Threats to ancient sites     Weather    What are the threats?&nbsp;   Most damage to ancient sites comes from exposure to the elements over a long period of time. Erosion occurs from natural weather conditions like heavy wind, rain, and snow. Hot, dry weather can cause stone and marble to crack. And extreme weather events like storms or floods might destroy a site completely.   How can we protect sites from these threats? &nbsp;  We usually can't cover an entire ancient site, so erosion from common weather events will happen. But some more fragile sections of a site - and any artefacts - can be covered or placed in a more sealed environment, such as a display room or a display case. And whilst natural disasters can't be prevented, a site can be protected by walls, drainage, or trees to create wind breaks.   If you could make one change to the site to restore or reconstruct it, what would you do? Why?   Of the digital preservation methods you explored, which one do you think best preserves ancient sites? Is digital preservation a good strategy for preserving ancient sites?   How can we mitigate risks to ancient sites from extreme weather events?&nbsp; &nbsp;   What are the benefits and potential risks of reconstruction? In your opinion, is this an effective way to protect or preserve an ancient site?   How could you make this site more accessible for tourists, without damaging the integrity of the site?   Describe two ways that education can help protect ancient sites   Use the World Heritage site from ancient Greece you looked at in the previous task (when looking at the selection criteria).

		"task_content" : "Light refraction    What is refraction?     If you have ever tried to run in water, you know that your body slows down and can't move normally. The same thing happens with light when it shines on dense material; it slows down. Not only does it slow down, but the light waves tend to bend in different directions. This bending of light is called  refraction .       How Refraction Occurs       You might have noticed this bending of light before when you see objects in water. Where the object meets the water, it looks out of place. This bending of the light happens at the point where air meets water.        Why does refraction occur?     When light moves from the less dense air to a ‘heavier’ - or more dense - environment, the light ray slows down as it can't pass through the object as quickly.   Light travels slowly through glass, a bit faster through water, and fastest through air. When using our glass of water example, this means that the light bends once when it travels through the glass cup into the water, and then it bends again when it travels out of the glass cup and into the air.&nbsp;   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To observe how the refraction of light affects an image     Materials         1 x A4 paper    Glass      Texta\/marker    Water         Method      On the piece of paper, use the marker to draw two arrows on it.

		"task_title" : "Light reflection",
		"task_content" : "Light reflection    What is reflection?     Probably the most simple thing we know about light is that it reflects. Reflection is not just the reason we can see ourselves in a mirror - but it is the only reason we can see anything at all! Light, either from the sun or something like an electric lightbulb in this room, reflects off objects into our eyes. This is why we can see the things that we do.&nbsp;    Ever wondered why you can't see anything in the dark? You can't see the objects around you, but they don't stop existing. Instead, the light source that has been reflecting off the object has gone, meaning we can no longer see the object.&nbsp;     Different types of reflection     When we think of reflection, we often think of mirrors. Because they have very smooth and polished surfaces, these types of surfaces produce what is called  specular  reflection, where the light reflects at the same angle as it hits the surface. This is why you can get a perfect reflection in a bathroom mirror, or how can you can see the sky and mountains reflected on the surface of a still lake on a clear day.&nbsp;    However, most objects are not so smooth and polished, which is why you can't see your face reflected back at you when you stare at a pile of loose pebbles. Light shining on rougher objects produces  diffuse  reflection, where the light scatters (or diffuses) off the surface in different directions.       Specular &amp; Diffusion Reflection         &nbsp;   If we needed to add light to a dark outside space, we would need to use a smooth reflective surface. We would also need to find and reflect the  focal point  of a source of light as that would give us the most amount of light in the dark space.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To explore how light reflects off a mirror and to identify the focal point     Materials         2 x small hand mirrors    Classroom lights (do not use sunlight)      1 x index card   &nbsp;        Method      Place the index card on a table and, using one of the mirrors and classroom lights, try to create a spot on the index card. The mirror can be moved into different positions or angles in order to get&nbsp; a light spot on the card. This bright spot is called the focal point    Try making your spot brighter. What did you have to do to make the light spot brighter?    After a few minutes of exploration, have a class discussion to review your results. Was each group able to create a spot on their index card? How did we make it brighter?    Try using two mirrors. What happens to the spot on the index card?    Join with another pair\/group. Using three or four mirrors together, try to create a bright spot on one index card on a table. What method created the best results?     Identify and explain which method gave the brightest light spot   Explain how you were able to create a light spot on your index card   Draw a diagram to show how you were able to get the brightest spot being reflected onto your index card. Save a copy or a photo of it here.  Include arrows to show the pathway of the light from the light source to the index card and label the mirror\/mirrors, light source, and index card.

A planet needs to have three key features:     It must orbit a star (in our solar system, this is the Sun).    It must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape. A rectangular asteroid is therefore not a planet    It must be big enough that its gravity cleared away any other objects of a similar size near its orbit around the Sun. A cluster of objects close together are therefore unlikely to be planets       How big are our planets?     Our solar system features  eight planets.  Although there is some debate within the scientific community as to whether Pluto should be classified as a planet or a ‘dwarf planet’, it is now widely accepted that it is not a planet.    Some planets in our solar system are really big while others are quite small.&nbsp;       Size and Distance in Our Solar System       For us to get an idea about each planet’s size, we are going to look at their scale compared with Earth.

For example, we can see that Jupiter is the largest planet (roughly 11 times bigger than Earth), and Mercury is the smallest (rough half the size of Earth).&nbsp;      Making our planets     Now it is time to make scale models of our planets! You will be making a model of each of the eight planets in the solar system.&nbsp;    You will start with Earth. Imagine you shrink Earth to a small sphere. You will then shrink all the seven other planets by the same proportion so that they are all at the same scale. You will then be able to see the sizes of each planet relative to the size of Earth.     Aim     To find out the sizes of the planets in our solar system compared with our Earth     Materials         4 x balloons (different colours preferable)    Ruler &amp; scissors      Small amount of Play-Doh    Pen or pencil      Cardboard (enough to label all planets)    Glue or tape         Method      Using the scissors, cut out 8 small labels, one for each planet. Write the names of each of the planets on one of these labels so that they can be used to identify which model represents which planet    Start by making a sphere out of play doh with a  2 cm diameter  to represent Earth. Check the diameter of your sphere by measuring it against the ruler. Place the Earth label on your model    Make a play doh sphere for Mercury with a diameter of a little under  1 cm . Check the diameter of your sphere by measuring it against the ruler. Place the Mercury label on your model    Make a play doh sphere for Venus with a diameter of a little under  2 cm . Check the diameter of your sphere by measuring it against the ruler. Place the Venus label on your model    Make a play doh sphere for Mars with a diameter of a little under  1 cm . Check the diameter of your sphere by measuring it against the ruler. Place the Mars label on your model    Jupiter has a diameter that is 11 times larger than Earth's diameter so, in your model, its diameter needs to be  22 cm . You will need to blow up a balloon until it has a diameter of about 22 cm and tie it. Check the diameter of your balloon by measuring it against the ruler. Place the Jupiter label on your model    Saturn has a diameter of about  19 cm . Blow up another balloon until it has a diameter of about 19 cm and tie it. Check the diameter of your balloon by measuring it against the ruler. Place the Saturn label on your model    Uranus has a diameter of  8 cm . Blow up another balloon (not too much) until it has a diameter of 8 cm and tie it. Check the diameter of your balloon by measuring it against the ruler. Place the Uranus label on your model    Neptune also has a diameter of  8 cm . Blow up your last balloon until it has a diameter of 8 cm and tie it. Check the diameter of your balloon by measuring it against the ruler. Place the Neptune label on your model    Place your model planets in the order they are listed in the table (first Mercury, then Venus, etc.). This is the order they appear in space with Mercury being closest to the Sun, and Neptune being the furthest away     Why do you think the last four planets are called the gas giants of our solar system? &nbsp;   Describe the size of the first four planets and the last four planets   Is Earth a relatively small planet or a relatively large planet?

The word recycle has two meanings - to convert waste into reusable materials, or to use something again.&nbsp;  Recycling when converting waste is a  reversible change . This means that some materials which are used to create different objects can be transformed back into the original material. For example, glass which is used to make a glass bottle can then be changed back into a sheet of glass, that can be recycled to make a glass tabletop.&nbsp;      Introduction to Recycling      Recycling is important because:    It allows us to reuse resources, some of which are limited or finite    It reduces landfill so that we have less rubbish in the world    It saves energy as making new products uses more energy than recycling old ones    By saving energy, we are also reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.

Bees gather pollen to stock their nests and therefore visit more plants than other pollinators who only need enough to feed themselves.

Bees are especially important for plants that have white, yellow, purple, and blue flowers – this is because these are the colours that their eyes can most easily see, so these are the flowers they most regularly pollinate\"",
		"task_title" : "What's happening to bees?",
		"task_content" : "What's happening to bees?    The importance of bees    As we have learnt, flowering plants can be pollinated by many different organisms. But by far the most important pollinator across global ecosystems is the bee.  Bees are responsible for pollinating as much as 80% of all flowering plants. They are nature's most effective pollinators - many species of bee have evolved to specifically pollinate a single species of plant. And because bees don't just feed on the pollen but also use it to build their nests and hives, they visit more flowers in a day than any other animal. That's why bees are the most important player in the pollination process that angiosperms depend on to reproduce.   Types of bees   There are over 20,000 species of bees worldwide. When you think of bees, you might think of a  honey bee.  These are the common bees that live in hives and colonies and which make the honey that you might have in your kitchen cupboard. But the majority of bee species are wild bees that don't live in colonies. Instead, they are solitary and make their own nests in holes in the ground or in tree trunks or logs.  It is these wild bees that are in greatest need of protection. The global population of honey bees is actually growing worldwide. But the population of native wild bees is falling. And wild bees are actually better pollinators than honey bees. A single wild bee can extract and deposit more pollen than three honey bees.      We're Saving the Wrong Bees       Which flowers do bees pollinate?   Bees see the world slightly differently than us. Their vision is poor as they have compound eyes that cannot focus on images at a distance. This means that bees tend to locate flowers first by their scent and then, as they get closer, by their colours.&nbsp;  They can see colours at the yellow and blue ends of the light spectrum most easily. This is why they're mainly attracted to white, yellow, purple, and blue flowers. Bees can't see red flowers, but may still feed on red flowers that have a strong scent. They can also see ultraviolet light which we cannot see. Many flowers have ‘ultraviolet nectar guides’ on them that are invisible to humans but which tell bees where to find nectar in a flower. The patterns on many flowers are like signposts telling bees where to find the nectar.  It isn't just wild flowers that bees pollinate.  70% of global food crops - which provide almost 90% of the world's nutrition - are pollinated by bees . This includes almost every type of fruit, vegetable, and nut. So if bee numbers plummet, the world could face unreliable crop harvests and food shortages.   If there are so many different species of bees, does it matter if one or two of them become extinct? Explain your answer and support it with evidence   Why should we be worried about the decline in bee populations?   Describe two reasons that bee populations are falling across the world. Which reason do you think is having the biggest impact? Why?   Why are bees such an important part of our ecosystem? Which angiosperms are they particularly important for? "

Iron oxide forms when iron combines with oxygen and moisture. This process leads to iron rusting. As the air is about 20% oxygen, iron in the open air will almost always rust.

For example, when white light shines on a red object, all of the colours that form the white light are absorbed except red, which is reflected. This is why the object we see appears red.

		"task_title" : "What's happening to bees?",
		"task_content" : "What's happening to bees?    The importance of bees    As we have learnt, flowering plants can be pollinated by many different organisms. But by far the most important pollinator across global ecosystems is the bee.  Bees are responsible for pollinating as much as 80% of all flowering plants. They are nature's most effective pollinators - many species of bee have evolved to specifically pollinate a single species of plant. And because bees don't just feed on the pollen but also use it to build their nests and hives, they visit more flowers in a day than any other animal. That's why bees are the most important player in the pollination process that angiosperms depend on to reproduce.   Types of bees   There are over 20,000 species of bees worldwide. When you think of bees, you might think of a  honey bee.  These are the common bees that live in hives and colonies and which make the honey that you might have in your kitchen cupboard. But the majority of bee species are wild bees that don't live in colonies. Instead, they are solitary and make their own nests in holes in the ground or in tree trunks or logs.  It is these wild bees that are in greatest need of protection. The global population of honey bees is actually growing worldwide. But the population of native wild bees is falling. And wild bees are actually better pollinators than honey bees. A single wild bee can extract and deposit more pollen than three honey bees.      We're Saving the Wrong Bees       Which flowers do bees pollinate?   Bees see the world slightly differently than us. Their vision is poor as they have compound eyes that cannot focus on images at a distance. This means that bees tend to locate flowers first by their scent and then, as they get closer, by their colours.&nbsp;  They can see colours at the yellow and blue ends of the light spectrum most easily. This is why they're mainly attracted to white, yellow, purple, and blue flowers. Bees can't see red flowers, but may still feed on red flowers that have a strong scent. They can also see ultraviolet light which we cannot see. Many flowers have ‘ultraviolet nectar guides’ on them that are invisible to humans but which tell bees where to find nectar in a flower. The patterns on many flowers are like signposts telling bees where to find the nectar.  It isn't just wild flowers that bees pollinate.  70% of global food crops - which provide almost 90% of the world's nutrition - are pollinated by bees . This includes almost every type of fruit, vegetable, and nut. So if bee numbers plummet, the world could face unreliable crop harvests and food shortages.   If there are so many different species of bees, does it matter if one or two of them become extinct? Explain your answer and support it with evidence   Why should we be worried about the decline in bee populations?   Describe two reasons that bee populations are falling across the world. Which reason do you think is having the biggest impact? Why?   Why are bees such an important part of our ecosystem? Which angiosperms are they particularly important for? "

He feared that this course of action might 'lose all the city or all its territory, and perhaps both together, the one being full of malcontents, the other full of suspicion.'He recommended that the leaders of both factions - even the Cancellieri, who were pro-Florence - be expelled from the city.

The new plants would compete with the parent plant for light, soil nutrients, and water - so it is likely that either the parent plant or some of the new seedlings would die.&nbsp;  Plants can't move, so they have had to evolve strategies to  disperse  - or scatter - their seeds further away from them. This increases the likelihood that the plant successfully passes its genes on to the next generation.&nbsp;  There are five main strategies which angiosperms use to disperse their seeds.   Wind dispersal   With wind dispersal, seeds are blown from the plant and germinate where they land (if they land in healthy soil). To help their chances that at least some of the seeds land in a place suitable for growth, these plants have to produce lots of seeds.  Seeds that are dispersed using the wind are light and can be carried long distances. Many have evolved shapes that help them stay airborne for longer. Some plants, like kauri and maple trees, have ‘winged’ seeds. They don’t float away but flutter to the ground. This softens their impact and reduces the chances of the seed being damaged.      How a Vortex Helps Dandelions Fly        Maple Seeds Falling       Water dispersal   Many plants have seeds that use water as a means of dispersal. The seeds float away from the parent plant. These plants have evolved seeds that have hard but light shells that allow them to float down streams and rivers.&nbsp;  For example, mangrove trees live in estuaries. If a mangrove seed falls during low tide, it can begin to root in the soil. If the seeds fall in the water, they are carried away by the tide to grow somewhere else.   Animal dispersal   Animals can disperse seeds both internally and externally.   Internally , animals are attracted to fruit and eat them for food. They also ingest the seeds. Most seeds will survive their journey through the digestive system due to their protective seed coat. They are then deposited in manure far away from the parent plant.      Fruit &amp; Animal Dispersal       Externally , animals can brush up against plants as they move through the undergrowth. Many plants have taken advantage of this by growing seeds as sticky or prickly  burrs  which stick to an animal's fur or feathers. They stick to the animal as it moves away from the plant and, when they eventually fall off, they are a long way from their parent plant.   Explosion   Some parent plants produce seeds in pods. When dry, these pods explode to spread their seeds as far away as possible.      Seed Dispersal by Explosion       Fire   In countries that experience regular bushfires (like Australia), some plants have adapted their seed dispersal to fire. Plants like banksias and eucalypts need the high temperatures of fires to trigger the release of their seeds.  Their seeds are often in cones or fruits that are completely sealed with resin. These cones\/fruits can only open to release their seeds after the heat of a fire has physically melted the resin. The intensity and timing of the fire is important. It needs to be hot enough to trigger the seeds to be released, but if fires are too frequent, there is not enough time for the plants to grow big enough to make new seeds.      Why the Giant Sequoia Needs Fire to Grow       Describe the characteristics of seeds that are dispersed by water, by animal fur\/feathers, and by wind   Explain why seeds need to be dispersed far away from their parent plant   Why is fruit usually sweet and pleasant to eat?   Is there a correlation between maximum time aloft and the distance each seed travelled? Explain your answer using examples from your experimental results "

		"task_content" : "Separating oil and water    Reversible changes    When two or more substances are mixed together, they can sometimes be separated again into two different substances. This is called a  reversible change .&nbsp;  A reversible change occurs when there is no chemical reaction as a result of mixing two substances together. When we mix salt and water, there is no chemical reaction - so therefore it is an example of a reversible change. This is because we can evaporate the water and then we are left with salt.  We can separate mixtures created by a reversible change. The techniques we can use include sieving, filtering, decanting, or magnetism.&nbsp;  Reversible changes can also occur when the  state  of a single substance changes. For example, you can take a hard block of chocolate and melt it - this changes its state from a solid to a liquid. But we can also freeze that liquid chocolate and it will turn back into a solid. No chemical change has occurred, so we can reverse both the melting and the freezing of chocolate.  &nbsp;    Irreversible changes    When we mix substances and a chemical change occurs - or when a chemical change occurs in a single substance - this will often be an example of an  irreversible change . In these cases, because a chemical change has occurred we can't reverse them.  For example, you can't ‘uncook’ an egg and return it to its raw state. You also can't ‘untoast’ a slice of bread. These changes are irreversible. The ‘cooking’ of both the egg and the bread is a chemical change which causes both substances to be changed in a way that can't be undone.  &nbsp;    Is an oil spill a reversible or irreversible change?    We saw in the last task that, when we mixed oil and water, the oil stayed on top of the water. It did not dissolve like salt or sugar, but it also didn't sink or become suspended in the water like flour or tea.&nbsp;  This is because the molecules that make up oil are different from the molecules that make up water. They don't mix together, so the two substances stay separate.      Why Don't Oil and Water Mix?      So, is mixing oil and water a reversible change?

If bee populations fall, we would have less resources and we might face more severe famines\"",
		"task_title" : "What's happening to bees?",
		"task_content" : "What's happening to bees?    The importance of bees    As we have learnt, flowering plants can be pollinated by many different organisms. But by far the most important pollinator across global ecosystems is the bee.  Bees are responsible for pollinating as much as 80% of all flowering plants. They are nature's most effective pollinators - many species of bee have evolved to specifically pollinate a single species of plant. And because bees don't just feed on the pollen but also use it to build their nests and hives, they visit more flowers in a day than any other animal. That's why bees are the most important player in the pollination process that angiosperms depend on to reproduce.   Types of bees   There are over 20,000 species of bees worldwide. When you think of bees, you might think of a  honey bee.  These are the common bees that live in hives and colonies and which make the honey that you might have in your kitchen cupboard. But the majority of bee species are wild bees that don't live in colonies. Instead, they are solitary and make their own nests in holes in the ground or in tree trunks or logs.  It is these wild bees that are in greatest need of protection. The global population of honey bees is actually growing worldwide. But the population of native wild bees is falling. And wild bees are actually better pollinators than honey bees. A single wild bee can extract and deposit more pollen than three honey bees.      We're Saving the Wrong Bees       Which flowers do bees pollinate?   Bees see the world slightly differently than us. Their vision is poor as they have compound eyes that cannot focus on images at a distance. This means that bees tend to locate flowers first by their scent and then, as they get closer, by their colours.&nbsp;  They can see colours at the yellow and blue ends of the light spectrum most easily. This is why they're mainly attracted to white, yellow, purple, and blue flowers. Bees can't see red flowers, but may still feed on red flowers that have a strong scent. They can also see ultraviolet light which we cannot see. Many flowers have ‘ultraviolet nectar guides’ on them that are invisible to humans but which tell bees where to find nectar in a flower. The patterns on many flowers are like signposts telling bees where to find the nectar.  It isn't just wild flowers that bees pollinate.  70% of global food crops - which provide almost 90% of the world's nutrition - are pollinated by bees . This includes almost every type of fruit, vegetable, and nut. So if bee numbers plummet, the world could face unreliable crop harvests and food shortages.   If there are so many different species of bees, does it matter if one or two of them become extinct? Explain your answer and support it with evidence   Why should we be worried about the decline in bee populations?   Describe two reasons that bee populations are falling across the world. Which reason do you think is having the biggest impact? Why?   Why are bees such an important part of our ecosystem? Which angiosperms are they particularly important for? "

		"task_content" : "Climate & biomes    What influences temperature and climate?    Temperature is a measure of heat in a certain place at a certain time. It's influenced by five main factors:    Latitude . The latitude of a place is its position on Earth relative to the equator. The closer a place is to the equator, the warmer it will be   Altitude .  The  altitude  of a place is its height above sea level. As altitude increases by 100m, the temperature decreases by around 1°C    Ocean temperatures &amp; currents . Shallower oceans, or oceans near the equator, are generally warmer. Deeper oceans and oceans closer to the Poles are cooler. Generally, places found next to a warm ocean will have higher temperatures and wetter climates. Places found next to cool oceans have colder and drier climates   Distance from oceans . Coastal locations tend to be cooler in summer and warmer in winter than inland areas. This is because oceans lose heat less quickly than land, so in winter an ocean will still retain some warmth from the summer sun   Topography (or relief) . The  aspect  of a slope (the direction it faces) affects its temperature. If it faces the sun during the day, it will be warmer than a slope facing away from the sun   The temperate of a place affects its air pressure. This in turn affects how much rainfall it gets and the direction of the prevailing wind in that area. These factors create the weather in a place. And long-term trends in a place's weather create its climate.      Which Factors Affect Temperatures     ?       How Does Temperature Affect Precipitation?

Direct contact with oil harms every organism in its path. For example, when oil cakes the feathers of a bird, it stops their feathers from repelling water. Oil also weighs down the bird, preventing it from flying. If the oil isn’t cleaned off the bird, it will die. Many birds also swallow deadly amounts of oil trying to clean their feathers.  The same is true for marine mammals. Fur acts as an insulator to keep the animal warm in the coldest waters. When oil saturates the fur, it ruins the ability of the fur to retain heat. Marine mammals can also be poisoned when they swallow the oil.&nbsp;  As oil floats on top of water, it blocks the sun and stops it from going into the water. Aquatic plants are the same as land plants - they need the sun to make their own food through photosynthesis. If you block the sun from getting to these aquatic plants, they can’t make their own food and they die. This results in less food for any aquatic animals that eat these plants.

		"task_title" : "What's happening to bees?",
		"task_content" : "What's happening to bees?    The importance of bees    As we have learnt, flowering plants can be pollinated by many different organisms. But by far the most important pollinator across global ecosystems is the bee.  Bees are responsible for pollinating as much as 80% of all flowering plants. They are nature's most effective pollinators - many species of bee have evolved to specifically pollinate a single species of plant. And because bees don't just feed on the pollen but also use it to build their nests and hives, they visit more flowers in a day than any other animal. That's why bees are the most important player in the pollination process that angiosperms depend on to reproduce.   Types of bees   There are over 20,000 species of bees worldwide. When you think of bees, you might think of a  honey bee.  These are the common bees that live in hives and colonies and which make the honey that you might have in your kitchen cupboard. But the majority of bee species are wild bees that don't live in colonies. Instead, they are solitary and make their own nests in holes in the ground or in tree trunks or logs.  It is these wild bees that are in greatest need of protection. The global population of honey bees is actually growing worldwide. But the population of native wild bees is falling. And wild bees are actually better pollinators than honey bees. A single wild bee can extract and deposit more pollen than three honey bees.      We're Saving the Wrong Bees       Which flowers do bees pollinate?   Bees see the world slightly differently than us. Their vision is poor as they have compound eyes that cannot focus on images at a distance. This means that bees tend to locate flowers first by their scent and then, as they get closer, by their colours.&nbsp;  They can see colours at the yellow and blue ends of the light spectrum most easily. This is why they're mainly attracted to white, yellow, purple, and blue flowers. Bees can't see red flowers, but may still feed on red flowers that have a strong scent. They can also see ultraviolet light which we cannot see. Many flowers have ‘ultraviolet nectar guides’ on them that are invisible to humans but which tell bees where to find nectar in a flower. The patterns on many flowers are like signposts telling bees where to find the nectar.  It isn't just wild flowers that bees pollinate.  70% of global food crops - which provide almost 90% of the world's nutrition - are pollinated by bees . This includes almost every type of fruit, vegetable, and nut. So if bee numbers plummet, the world could face unreliable crop harvests and food shortages.   If there are so many different species of bees, does it matter if one or two of them become extinct? Explain your answer and support it with evidence   Why should we be worried about the decline in bee populations?   Describe two reasons that bee populations are falling across the world. Which reason do you think is having the biggest impact? Why?   Why are bees such an important part of our ecosystem? Which angiosperms are they particularly important for? "

		"task_title" : "Why does liveability differ across places?",
		"task_content" : "Why does liveability differ across places?    Spatial variation in liveability    Based on your perceptions of liveability, are cities or country towns more liveable? Where would you prefer to live?  Spatial variation refers to differences in patterns between areas or regions. For example, some suburbs in the same city report higher rates of crime than their neighbouring suburbs. And there is often a difference in education and income levels between people who live in more urban areas and those who live in rural areas.  These spatial variations inevitably lead to differences in liveability within countries and places.  &nbsp;    Why are cities generally more liveable?    Most people choose to live in urban areas due to employment opportunities and access to services. With their large population and greater wealth - due to greater economic activity - urban areas have better access to services such as schools, medical facilities, shopping centres, and recreation facilities.  For example,  Tokyo  (the capital of Japan) is home to over 37 million residents and has thousands of medical centres, convenience stores, and public amenities to cater for them.&nbsp;      Tokyo - City Guide      Due to their large populations but limited land size, urban areas tend to have high and medium  density  housing. This means that lots of people are living in close proximity, generally in high-rise apartments. This is an efficient use of space but it can increase  congestion  (how crowded a place is). High-density living also needs to be balanced by plenty of public spaces so that people don't feel ‘walled in’.      Singapore - Balancing Density &amp; Space      Many people prefer space to density. That's why a city's suburbs tend to grow quickly. Suburbs offer relative proximity to cities but tend to be more affordable and can offer more medium and low density housing. To support suburbs, a city needs excellent public transport and good roads. When this doesn't happen, liveability decreases.      Liveability in the Suburbs      However, this doesn't mean all cities are equally liveable. Whether one city is more liveable than another can depend on many factors - like how well-planned the city is, how wealthy it is, how good the government is, the space available for that city, and how old it is.  &nbsp;    Why are rural areas generally less liveable?    In developed countries, rural areas are far less populated than urban cities. Rural land is usually used for agriculture and, because rural towns generally don't have large economies supporting a diverse range of jobs, they find it harder to attract as many people as cities.  This combination of fewer people and less wealth means rural areas do not have the same access to services - like schools, healthcare, and entertainment venues - as cities.  For example, there are over 200 hospitals in greater Sydney but only 15 for the rest of New South Wales - even though Sydney only takes up 1.5% of NSW's land! This is because it is too expensive to build and run hospitals in rural areas where the populations are small, and it is hard to attract the specialist staff needed to work in them.  In some countries, rural areas are less liveable because of very unequal  wealth distribution . This means that a country's wealth is controlled by the wealthiest and most powerful citizens, who usually live in cities. Either because of neglect or corruption in these countries, regional areas receive limited funding and can't afford the services and facilities that its citizens need.

If you've never had the good fortune to visit it, use the links below to explore it!      Google Earth - the Acropolis        Explore the Acropolis in 360°      Over the centuries in ancient Greece, the Acropolis was many things: a home to kings, a citadel, a mythical home of the gods, a religious centre, and more. It is home to several temples - the  Parthenon  is the most famous of these.  The Acropolis dates all the way back to 4000 BCE, but it was made into an amazing site that can still be appreciated today in the 5th century BCE. As the ancient Greek civilisation grew and as thought and art flourished, the Acropolis became the heart of the empire. To this day, it serves as a monument to art, architecture, and government, and is viewed as a symbol of classical spirit and civilization given to the world by the ancient Greeks.      Secrets of the Acropolis      It also is a major tourist attraction and an important contributor to Athens's economy. More than 7 million people visit it each year.

		"task_content" : "How do enzymes help digestion?    Digestive enzymes    An  enzyme  is a type of  catalyst.  A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up a specific chemical reaction. In digestion, most enzymes are used to chemically breakdown a specific large substance into its smaller chemical ‘building block’ components.  All digestive enzymes are  hydrolases , which means they use water to break chemical bonds joining larger molecules together. When these chemical bonds are broken, the smaller molecules can be rapidly absorbed through the gut or intestinal wall.      Digestive Enzymes      Each digestive enzyme is specialised to produce one type of chemical reaction which breaks down one specific substance.

		"task_title" : "What is the digestive system?",
		"task_content" : "What is the digestive system?    What is the digestive system?    All living organisms are made up of specialised cells within specialised tissues which are part of specialised organs. These organs work together to make a system. These  bodily systems  work together to help an organism function.  The primary function of the  digestive system  is to break down food and extract nutrients from it. This is used for energy and to help an organism grow and repair itself.   Digestion  occurs when food is broken down from larger and more complex substances into smaller, simple molecules. The foods we eat contain proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Our digestive system breaks these down and then absorbs and uses the smaller molecules within them for different processes in our body.      How the Digestive System Works      Most humans eat between 1.2-2.2 kilograms of food each day. That's over half a ton of food each year! But because of our digestive system, this food doesn't just sit in our stomachs like a lead weight. It gets digested through five key steps:    Ingestion  (when we take food into our bodies)   Mechanical digestion  (when we chew food to break it into smaller pieces to enable us to swallow it)   Chemical digestion  (special chemicals called enzymes break down food into smaller molecules)   Absorption of nutrients    Egestion  (when we excrete unusable or undigested materials)   &nbsp;    How does our digestive system work?    Each part of the digestive system helps break down and move food through the  gastrointestinal tract  (or digestive tract) which leads from the mouth to the anus.   The mouth   Our mouth is responsible for physically and chemically breaking down food. Physically, our teeth, jaw, and tongue break down food into smaller pieces through biting, grinding, and chewing. This is called  mechanical digestion .  Salivary glands make saliva to help make the food slippery. Saliva ensures food can be easily moved around our mouth and swallowed. Saliva also contains  amylase  which is an  enzyme  that chemically breaks down carbohydrates (like bread) into simple sugars (like glucose). By breaking down our food into smaller pieces through mechanical digestion, the enzymes in chemical digestion can act on this food more easily.   The oesophagus   The oesophagus is a muscular tube that transports food and drink from the mouth to the stomach. When we swallow food, these muscles squeeze the food down through a process called  peristalsis . This massaging of food down your oesophagus is so powerful that you can even swallow if you are hanging upside down.  At the end of the oesophagus is a weak  sphincter  (ring of muscle) that allows food to enter the stomach. This sphincter normally stays closed to stop what is in your stomach from flowing back up your oesophagus.   The stomach   The stomach is a bag of muscle that is lined with mucus. Like the mouth, the stomach has both mechanical and chemical digestion occurring within it. The stomach’s muscles physically churn the stomach contents while  pepsin  (an enzyme) and  hydrochloric acid  chemically break down any proteins.  This hydrochloric acid is very acidic and is usually at a pH of between 1.5 - 3.5. The stomach lining is covered in mucus so that the pepsin and hydrochloric acid won’t begin to digest the stomach muscle itself!  Different foods take different amounts of time to transit through the stomach. ‘Heavier’, protein-based foods (like meat and seafood) generally take longer than foods with a high liquid content (like fruit).      What Does the Stomach Do?       The small intestines   Food leaves the stomach as a runny, smelly liquid called  chyme . It enters the small intestine, which is actually quite long (about five metres) but very narrow.  The small intestine makes a digestive ‘juice’ using enzymes produced in the  pancreas  and an acidic  bile  produced in the liver. This ‘juice’ completes the break down of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.  The small intestine is lined with structures called  villi  which increase the surface area through which nutrients can be absorbed.      Small Intestine &amp; Food Absorption       The large intestines   The large intestines are shorter than the small intestines (around 1.5 metres) but are wider. This is where the final part of digestion occurs.  Water and some vitamins are absorbed into the body. Bacteria help break down any remaining nutrients. Any remaining fibre and undigested food is stored in the lower part of the large intestine (called the  rectum ) until it is expelled from the body through the  anus  as faeces.     &nbsp;    Modelling the digestive system      Aim     To use everyday items to model the structure and function of parts of the digestive system     Materials         Potato masher (or other implement to crush food)    Medium Ziploc bag      Bowl &amp; plate\/tray    A pair of stockings\/tights      Funnel    30 mL water      1 x 400 mL beaker    30 mL lemon juice or vinegar      1 x 50 mL measuring cylinder    Plain biscuit      Scissors    Small banana or piece of bread         Method     Place the biscuit and banana in a bowl and gently crush both using the potato masher  Pour the crushed food into an empty ziploc bag  Using the measuring cylinder, measure out 30 ml of water and pour it into the ziploc bag.

This means that they can  change state  - turn from a solid to a liquid, or a liquid to a gas - when the temperature changes enough.    For example, water is liquid at room temperature but turns into ice - a solid&nbsp;- when the temperature is lowered below water's freezing point. And if you add enough heat, water turns into water vapour and steam when it boils - both of which are gases.    Changes of state in matter occurs when  heat energy is transferred to or from the matter.  The energy causes the atoms in the matter to vibrate faster or slower, depending on whether they are being heated (gaining more energy) or cooled (losing energy).&nbsp;    When enough heat is added, the atoms vibrate so fast that they break free of their bonds and move around more freely. This is why a solid can turn into a liquid, or a liquid into a gas. The opposite happens when the matter is cooled - the atoms vibrate more slowly and become more locked together, turning from a gas into a liquid or a liquid into a solid.       Changes      of State in Matter     There are four main changes in state:     Freezing : when a liquid turns into a solid     Melting : when a solid turns into a liquid     Evaporation : when a liquid turns into a gas.

Evaporation is a natural part of the  water cycle  and it occurs even when temperatures are below boiling. Whenever the sun hits water, the sun warms the surface of the water. This is enough for the atoms in the surface of the water to move fast enough to break free of their bonds, and some water escapes as a gas.  This is a problem. In hot dry areas with lots of sunlight, fresh water from rivers, dams, and reservoirs is evaporated quickly. Even though the water vapour only spends around nine days in the atmosphere, when it falls to Earth as rain it might not find its way into a drinking water catchment. So the more water we lose to evaporation, the less we have available for drinking!     Experiment     We know that water will evaporate when it is heated. We can't stop the Sun from shining - so is there anything else we can do to slow the process of evaporation?    One factor we can control is the  surface area  of water.   Surface area is the amount of a surface's area that is exposed to the environment.&nbsp;    In this experiment, we will compare the evaporation of water from a container with a small surface area (a glass) with a container that has a large surface area (a bowl).

		"task_content" : "Forces in action - slides    Inclined planes     Inclined planes are simple machines that make our work easier by manipulating the direction and magnitude of the force. They make working against gravity easier by reducing the ratio of the force applied to the output force (the gravitational potential energy acquired when an object is raised).    This means that the longer the inclined plane gets, the easier the task will be in terms of force. A good example is walking up a ramp to enter a building. If the ramp is longer (and therefore less steep), it feels easier than a shorter, steeper ramp.    Inclined planes can also be used in playgrounds to create equipment such as the slide.&nbsp;    The potential energy gained by a person in climbing to the top of the slide is changed into kinetic energy when the person slides down. Some potential energy can also be changed into other forms of energy due to friction.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To study how increasing a slide’s height affects how fast objects travel down the slide     Materials         1-metre ruler    Toy car      Cardboard, scissors, &amp; sticky tape    Kitchen\/lab scales      Retort stand    Stopwatch or timer       &nbsp;    Method     Cut the cardboard to create a long section of ‘track’ with walls on the sides.

The ‘walls’ of the track should be around 10 cm high  Using sticky tape, stick the walls to the track  Create a shorter section of track which is just wider than the longer section. For example, this could be 25 cm wide and 40 cm long. It must be wide enough so that the end of the longer section of track can fit neatly and tightly inside the end of the shorter section. Create walls for the shorter section of track  Using sticky tape, stick the walls to the shorter track  Place one end of the longer track inside the shorter section of track. Raise the other end of the longer section of track and rest it against the retort stand to create an incline plane and a downward sloping ramp. The height of the top of the incline should be  10 cm .

Turning Forces       The torque or the turning force is calculated by multiplying the applied force (in N) by the distance (in metres) of the applied force from the pivot.

In some cases, restoration and preservation is a never-ending process.  &nbsp;    Threats to ancient sites     Weather    What are the threats?&nbsp;   Most damage to ancient sites comes from exposure to the elements over a long period of time.

And extreme weather events like storms or floods might destroy a site completely.   How can we protect sites from these threats? &nbsp;  We usually can't cover an entire ancient site, so erosion from common weather events will happen. But some more fragile sections of a site - and any artefacts - can be covered or placed in a more sealed environment, such as a display room or a display case. And whilst natural disasters can't be prevented, a site can be protected by walls, drainage, or trees to create wind breaks.

		"task_content" : "Do digestive enzyme tablets really work?    How do we know digestive enzyme tablets work?    You know how our digestive system works. You know that enzymes play a key role in breaking down food and delivering energy and nutrients to our body quicker. And, when our bodies aren't working properly, digestive enzyme tablets can supplement our naturally-occuring enzymes to assist our digestive system.   But    do digestive enzyme tablets actually work?   &nbsp;    For a digestive enzyme tablet to ‘work’, scientists must prove that it speeds up the chemical digestion of various foods under a range of conditions. To test this, scientists must test a tablet under the same conditions as those found in the human digestive system.&nbsp;    As all enzymes must spend some time in the stomach, this means they must survive high levels of acidity. Some pharmaceutical companies try to solve this problem by coating their tablets with a protective shell which prevents it from dissolving until it reaches the stomach or the small intestine. This is called  enteric coating .    Scientists would also need to test how enzymes function under different temperature conditions. They need to replicate the different temperatures a digestive enzyme tablet might endure in the human body and when it is transported and stored prior to consumption.   &nbsp;    Test a digestive enzyme tablet!     You and your team must work as scientists to test a digestive enzyme tablet. You're checking its effectiveness to verify that it actually works, and that it isn't just a clever piece of marketing.     Here's what you'll need to do:      Choose a digestive enzyme tablet or supplement to test. Isolate the enzyme contained in the tablet    Decide how to test how your tablet's function is affected by  either or both  of pH and temperature    Develop and run a scientific experiment to test the effectiveness of your digestive enzyme tablet     You'll need to design an experiment in which you can simulate the conditions the tablet would encounter in the stomach. Because temperature and pH level both influence enzyme function, you'll need to make sure the tablet can withstand the conditions it will encounter as it travels through the gastrointestinal tract.    The tablet needs to function (to enhance digestion) in the same temperature and pH conditions as will occur in the body. You'll need to test whether, in these conditions, the tablet helps break down food to its smaller ‘building block’ molecules.     Creating your scientific experiment     You'll need to create and write out your experimental protocol as a team. It needs to include:      An aim . A sentence about what you are trying to do     Hypothesis . An educated guess for what your results might be. Use an “ If ... then … ” statement that is testable     Variables . Identify the dependent variable (what is being measured in each trial), independent variable (what is being changed in each trial), and the controlled variables (what is being kept the same in each trial)     Materials . A list of everything you will need to conduct your experiment     Method . A set of instructions for how you conducted your experiment     Results table .   An accurate and complete set of the data you have collected     Discussion of your results .   Was there a relationship between your dependent and independent variables? Why\/why not? How do these results help you decide whether or not your digestive enzyme works?     Conclusion .   Was your hypothesis supported or not? How could you improve your experiment if you were to repeat it? What would be useful to investigate further?     Recommendations .   Based on your research and experimental results, does your digestive enzyme work like the product claims it does? Or should it be banned because it doesn't work?     Create a results table in which you will capture data from your experiment. You can do this digitally or by hand.&nbsp;  Record your observations from your experiment in it. Save a copy of it here   What is your experimental method? How will your experiment be conducted?   What is your experimental aim? And what is your hypothesis?   Analyse your results. What do they suggest about how your digestive enzyme tablet works in different conditions?   Create a results table in which you will capture data from your experiment. You can do this digitally or by hand.&nbsp;  Record your observations from your experiment in it. Save a copy of it here   Analyse your results. Are they expected? Did they validate or refute your hypothesis?   What materials will you need to conduct your experiment?   What is your experimental aim? And what is your hypothesis?   What are the dependent, independent, and control variables present in your experiment?   What materials will you need to conduct your experiment?   What is your experimental method? How will your experiment be conducted?   What are the dependent, independent, and control variables present in your experiment?   Write a conclusion which summarises your findings. You should include commentary on:   Was your hypothesis supported or not?  How could you improve your experiment if you were to repeat it?  What would be useful to investigate further?  Does your digestive enzyme work? Or should it be pulled from the shelves for making false claims?  "

		"task_content" : "When do enzymes work best?    Factors affecting enzyme function    We know that digestion requires chemical reactions to break up food molecules into their ‘building block’ smaller molecules. Enzymes are the catalysts that speed up these chemical reactions. But these enzymes don't always work at peak effectiveness. They work best in a very specific set of conditions.   Temperature   Chemical reactions generally work faster at higher temperatures. This is because molecules move faster as temperatures increase, so there are more molecules moving fast enough to encounter and react with each other.  However, with enzymes there are upper limits. You can't just keep increasing the temperature forever to get faster and faster reactions. Beyond a certain point, extra heat decreases the speed at which enzymes produce chemical reactions.  Enzymes work best at a  normal body temperature . For most people, this is somewhere between 36.1°C to 37.2°C. When temperatures increase beyond this (especially above 40°C), enzymes start to  denature . This means the bonds that bind the enzyme molecules start to break down. The enzyme either dissolves or it ceases to function properly.      How Enzymes      Denature      pH   pH is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a given solution. A pH of 7 is neutral. A pH of 1–6 is acidic. And a pH of 8–14 is basic.  The pH level of your digestive system (especially your stomach or intestines) also affects enzyme activity. Enzymes generally work best within a very narrow pH range. If the environment surrounding an enzyme becomes too acidic or too basic, it will stop functioning.  Each enzyme has its own ideal pH range. For example, the enzyme pepsin (which breaks down proteins) functions best at a pH of around 1.6 (very acidic). This is because it operates in the stomach, in the presence of very strong hydrochloric acid. By contrast, amylase generally functions best at a pH of around 7 (neutral).   Diet   Our diet also has a big impact on our digestive system. This is because many foods contain digestive enzymes which help the enzymes in our body to break the food down.  For example, bananas are packed with carbohydrates. But they also contain amylase. This added amylase helps your body break down the carbs and convert it to energy quicker. That's why you'll see elite athletes like tennis players eating bananas in their breaks. They are digested quickly, providing a fast energy boost.  But sometimes if we eat too much of a certain type of food - for example, too much fatty food - our enzymes can't work quickly enough to break it all down. This can cause digestive issues like indigestion or nausea.      How Our Food Affects Our Gut       Which test tube\/test tubes showed evidence of the amylase working? How do you know?

This means that they can  change state  - turn from a solid to a liquid, or a liquid to a gas - when the temperature changes enough.    For example, water is liquid at room temperature but turns into ice - a solid&nbsp;- when the temperature is lowered below water's freezing point. And if you add enough heat, water turns into water vapour and steam when it boils - both of which are gases.    Changes of state in matter occurs when  heat energy is transferred to or from the matter.  The energy causes the atoms in the matter to vibrate faster or slower, depending on whether they are being heated (gaining more energy) or cooled (losing energy).&nbsp;    When enough heat is added, the atoms vibrate so fast that they break free of their bonds and move around more freely. This is why a solid can turn into a liquid, or a liquid into a gas. The opposite happens when the matter is cooled - the atoms vibrate more slowly and become more locked together, turning from a gas into a liquid or a liquid into a solid.       Changes      of State in Matter     There are four main changes in state:     Freezing : when a liquid turns into a solid     Melting : when a solid turns into a liquid     Evaporation : when a liquid turns into a gas. This might also be called  vapourisation  if this change in state occurs above the liquid's boiling point    Condensation : when a gas or vapour turns into a liquid   There are two less common changes in state which we won't explore:     Sublimation : when a solid turns straight into a gas, without turning into a liquid first     Deposition : when a gas turns straight into a solid, without turning into a liquid first    &nbsp;     &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To demonstrate under what conditions water changes its state of matter     Materials         Water    Metal tray      Ice cubes    Oven glove      Electric kettle   &nbsp;        Method      Pass around ice cubes amongst students.

		"task_title" : "What is the digestive system?",
		"task_content" : "What is the digestive system?    What is the digestive system?    All living organisms are made up of specialised cells within specialised tissues which are part of specialised organs. These organs work together to make a system. These  bodily systems  work together to help an organism function.  The primary function of the  digestive system  is to break down food and extract nutrients from it. This is used for energy and to help an organism grow and repair itself.   Digestion  occurs when food is broken down from larger and more complex substances into smaller, simple molecules. The foods we eat contain proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Our digestive system breaks these down and then absorbs and uses the smaller molecules within them for different processes in our body.      How the Digestive System Works      Most humans eat between 1.2-2.2 kilograms of food each day. That's over half a ton of food each year! But because of our digestive system, this food doesn't just sit in our stomachs like a lead weight. It gets digested through five key steps:    Ingestion  (when we take food into our bodies)   Mechanical digestion  (when we chew food to break it into smaller pieces to enable us to swallow it)   Chemical digestion  (special chemicals called enzymes break down food into smaller molecules)   Absorption of nutrients    Egestion  (when we excrete unusable or undigested materials)   &nbsp;    How does our digestive system work?    Each part of the digestive system helps break down and move food through the  gastrointestinal tract  (or digestive tract) which leads from the mouth to the anus.   The mouth   Our mouth is responsible for physically and chemically breaking down food. Physically, our teeth, jaw, and tongue break down food into smaller pieces through biting, grinding, and chewing. This is called  mechanical digestion .  Salivary glands make saliva to help make the food slippery. Saliva ensures food can be easily moved around our mouth and swallowed. Saliva also contains  amylase  which is an  enzyme  that chemically breaks down carbohydrates (like bread) into simple sugars (like glucose). By breaking down our food into smaller pieces through mechanical digestion, the enzymes in chemical digestion can act on this food more easily.   The oesophagus   The oesophagus is a muscular tube that transports food and drink from the mouth to the stomach. When we swallow food, these muscles squeeze the food down through a process called  peristalsis . This massaging of food down your oesophagus is so powerful that you can even swallow if you are hanging upside down.  At the end of the oesophagus is a weak  sphincter  (ring of muscle) that allows food to enter the stomach. This sphincter normally stays closed to stop what is in your stomach from flowing back up your oesophagus.   The stomach   The stomach is a bag of muscle that is lined with mucus. Like the mouth, the stomach has both mechanical and chemical digestion occurring within it. The stomach’s muscles physically churn the stomach contents while  pepsin  (an enzyme) and  hydrochloric acid  chemically break down any proteins.  This hydrochloric acid is very acidic and is usually at a pH of between 1.5 - 3.5. The stomach lining is covered in mucus so that the pepsin and hydrochloric acid won’t begin to digest the stomach muscle itself!  Different foods take different amounts of time to transit through the stomach. ‘Heavier’, protein-based foods (like meat and seafood) generally take longer than foods with a high liquid content (like fruit).      What Does the Stomach Do?       The small intestines   Food leaves the stomach as a runny, smelly liquid called  chyme . It enters the small intestine, which is actually quite long (about five metres) but very narrow.  The small intestine makes a digestive ‘juice’ using enzymes produced in the  pancreas  and an acidic  bile  produced in the liver. This ‘juice’ completes the break down of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.  The small intestine is lined with structures called  villi  which increase the surface area through which nutrients can be absorbed.      Small Intestine &amp; Food Absorption       The large intestines   The large intestines are shorter than the small intestines (around 1.5 metres) but are wider. This is where the final part of digestion occurs.  Water and some vitamins are absorbed into the body. Bacteria help break down any remaining nutrients. Any remaining fibre and undigested food is stored in the lower part of the large intestine (called the  rectum ) until it is expelled from the body through the  anus  as faeces.     &nbsp;    Modelling the digestive system      Aim     To use everyday items to model the structure and function of parts of the digestive system     Materials         Potato masher (or other implement to crush food)    Medium Ziploc bag      Bowl &amp; plate\/tray    A pair of stockings\/tights      Funnel    30 mL water      1 x 400 mL beaker    30 mL lemon juice or vinegar      1 x 50 mL measuring cylinder    Plain biscuit      Scissors    Small banana or piece of bread         Method     Place the biscuit and banana in a bowl and gently crush both using the potato masher  Pour the crushed food into an empty ziploc bag  Using the measuring cylinder, measure out 30 ml of water and pour it into the ziploc bag. The water represents saliva  Using the measuring cylinder, measure out 30 ml of the lemon juice or vinegar  Pour the lemon juice or vinegar into the bag. This fluid represents the stomach acid. &nbsp;Make sure there is no air in the bag and seal it  Squeeze the bag for about a minute, further crushing up the biscuits and banana. This represents the mechanical digestion inside the stomach  Once the stomach contents feel like a thick liquid, cut a small hole in the one corner and carefully squeeze it into the open leg of the tights (small intestine)  Hold the tights over the tray or a bowl and gently squeeze the liquid out. The liquid on the tray represents the nutrients the body absorbs and uses  Keep squeezing until no more liquid comes out. The food left behind in the tights represents waste products that cannot be absorbed  Cut a hole in the bottom of the tights and squeeze the contents into the jar.

		"task_content" : "Forces in action - slides    Inclined planes     Inclined planes are simple machines that make our work easier by manipulating the direction and magnitude of the force. They make working against gravity easier by reducing the ratio of the force applied to the output force (the gravitational potential energy acquired when an object is raised).    This means that the longer the inclined plane gets, the easier the task will be in terms of force. A good example is walking up a ramp to enter a building. If the ramp is longer (and therefore less steep), it feels easier than a shorter, steeper ramp.    Inclined planes can also be used in playgrounds to create equipment such as the slide.&nbsp;    The potential energy gained by a person in climbing to the top of the slide is changed into kinetic energy when the person slides down. Some potential energy can also be changed into other forms of energy due to friction.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To study how increasing a slide’s height affects how fast objects travel down the slide     Materials         1-metre ruler    Toy car      Cardboard, scissors, &amp; sticky tape    Kitchen\/lab scales      Retort stand    Stopwatch or timer       &nbsp;    Method     Cut the cardboard to create a long section of ‘track’ with walls on the sides.

Create walls for the shorter section of track  Using sticky tape, stick the walls to the shorter track  Place one end of the longer track inside the shorter section of track.

This helps us make sense of a contemporary account whilst also using a later analysis to fill in gaps in our understanding.  In this task, we will look at the democratic process of  ostracising  a citizen from Athens.  Ostracism  was a process where members of society could vote to have a citizen exiled from Athens for 10 years. It was used to make sure tyrants could not control the city, and to stop threats to the State which citizens feared.  Let’s quickly learn a little more about what ostracism was from a  secondary source . This is a secondary source because Plutarch - though an ancient Greek philosopher and historian - was writing about this event at a later time (and not as a witness).   Source 1 (secondary source)    “The method of procedure - to give a general outline - was as follows. Each voter took an ostrakon, wrote on it the name of that citizen whom he wished to remove from the city, and brought it to a place in the agora which was all fenced about with railings. The archons first counted the total number of ostraka cast. For if the voters were less than six thousand, the ostracism was void. Then they separated the names, and the man who had received the most votes they proclaimed banished for ten years, with the right to enjoy the income from his property.\"  Plutarch, Plutarch's Lives, trans. Bernadotte Perrin (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1914), 2.   In this source:     Ostrakon \/ Ostraka (plural ) = small piece(s) of pottery     Agora  = central public space     Archons  = chief members of council     How would your conclusions about ostracism be different if you had only examined Source 1 (a secondary source) and not Source 2 (secondary) &amp; Sources 3 &amp; 4 (primary sources)?

Reflection is not just the reason we can see ourselves in a mirror - but it is the only reason we can see anything at all! Light, either from the sun or something like an electric lightbulb in this room, reflects off objects into our eyes. This is why we can see the things that we do.&nbsp;    Ever wondered why you can't see anything in the dark? You can't see the objects around you, but they don't stop existing. Instead, the light source that has been reflecting off the object has gone, meaning we can no longer see the object.&nbsp;     Different types of reflection     When we think of reflection, we often think of mirrors. Because they have very smooth and polished surfaces, these types of surfaces produce what is called  specular  reflection, where the light reflects at the same angle as it hits the surface. This is why you can get a perfect reflection in a bathroom mirror, or how can you can see the sky and mountains reflected on the surface of a still lake on a clear day.&nbsp;    However, most objects are not so smooth and polished, which is why you can't see your face reflected back at you when you stare at a pile of loose pebbles. Light shining on rougher objects produces  diffuse  reflection, where the light scatters (or diffuses) off the surface in different directions.       Specular &amp; Diffusion Reflection         &nbsp;   If we needed to add light to a dark outside space, we would need to use a smooth reflective surface.

		"task_content" : "Shadows    Light &amp; shadow     Shadows are made by blocking light. Light rays travel from a source, like the sun, in straight lines. If a solid (opaque) object gets in the way, it stops light rays from travelling through it. This results in an area of darkness appearing behind the object. The dark area is called a shadow.&nbsp;    Sunlight that travels towards the Earth takes just over 8 minutes to reach us. It travels at nearly 300,000 kilometres per second! When the rays reach Earth, they hit whatever is in their path. If the object they hit is opaque, the light cannot pass through, and a shadow forms.&nbsp;    This is why the Norwegian town of  Rjukan  is in darkness for six months of the year - the light rays from the sun hit the mountain before they reach the town.    It is easy to see shadows on bright, sunny days outside - objects such as trees, buildings and people form shadows in these conditions. But shadows also appear indoors due to artificial light.&nbsp;         Sundials     Humans first began using shadows to help tell the time of day thousands of years ago. They do this using  sundials . The oldest known  sundial  was made by the Ancient Egyptians and dates back to 1500 BCE.&nbsp;    A sundial used the shadows cast by the sun to tell the time of day. A dial would be placed in the centre of a circle with markings around the edge, indicating times of the day. As the Sun changes relative positions in the sky over the day, the position of the shadow cast by the dial changes to align with the different times around the outside of the circular plate. This way you can tell the time by looking at where the shadow is cast, using the markings around the edge of the circle.       How Sundials Use the Sun and Shadows to Tell the Time       The shadows cast by the sun change throughout the day and throughout the year as the sun's position in the sky also changes. This is why the town of  Rjukan  is only in darkness for six months, not for the whole year. In spring anmd summer, the position of the Sun has changed - so the Sun's rays hit the town instead of being blocked by the mountain.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To investigate shadows by making a human sundial     Materials         Open space with concrete or another hard surface    A clock      Chalk    Tape measure         Method      You need a clear, sunny day for this experiment. Check the weather forecast first!    Go to your open area where you can mark your sundial. You will need to visit it at least four times during the day so it needs to be nearby    Draw a small circle (or make an X) on the ground to mark where your partner will stand each time you measure their shadow. It’s important to stand in the same place each time to get accurate measurements    Early in the day (possibly 9:00 AM or 10:00 AM), have your partner stand on the marked spot. Your partner can also raise their arms up and clasped them above their head so they are like the hour hand on a clock    Trace your partner’s shadow using sidewalk chalk &amp; write the time next to it    Measure the length of your partner’s shadow and record it in your results table    Measure the distance from the last shadow    Record the direction that the shadow has moved from the last shadow by noting the path of the sun. (HINT: the sun rises in the east and sets in the west)    Come back at regular intervals throughout the day &amp; trace your shadow again, noting the time next to each tracing. You may want to&nbsp; check every hour but you could also do every 2-3 hours if you want. For example, if you make your first measurement at 9:00 AM, your next three could be at 11:00 AM, 1:00 PM, &amp; 3:00 PM     In general, how many centimetres does the shadow move between tracings? What direction does the shadow move across the day?   What is the relationship between the sun and your shadow? How did your shadow change throughout the day?   Create a line graph based on the change in the length of your shadows. You can do this digitally or by hand. Save a copy of it here.  Your graph will need to have the length of the shadow on the Y axis and the times that your shadow was measured on the X axis. You must include an accurate title for your graph (what is it showing?), appropriate and accurate scales for each of the axes, accurate plotting of your data, and labels for each axis   At what time of the day was the shadow at its shortest? At its longest? What affects the length of the shadow? "

There are many different tectonic plates and each of them are a different size. Look at the image below - it shows you a picture with all the different tectonic plates and where they are located. Remember, the plates are underneath the Earth’s surface and we cannot see them.      &nbsp;    Continental drift    These tectonic plates aren't fixed in place. They are moving very slightly each year. They move because of different forces within the Earth - hot or cool currents of  magma  (molten rock) push the plates in different directions.  This process of tectonic plates moving - and our continents shifting as a result - is called  continental drift .  We know that continental drift isn't something new. Hundreds of millions of years ago, all the world's continents were actually joined together in one giant  supercontinent  called  Pangaea . But continental drift caused the tectonic plates to move away from each other. This broke up the continents into the separate landmasses we know today.      How Pangaea Broke Apart       We can see the evidence of continental drift today. The  Himalayas  - the tallest mountain range in the world - was formed when the Indian tectonic plate moved north over millions of years and rammed into the Eurasian plate. When the two plates hit each other, one was forced upwards. This created the mountain range.   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To simulate the movement of tectonic plates     Materials        &nbsp; Paper plates    Plain cookies or Marie biscuits         Method      Place both cookies next to each other on the plate and let their edges touch    Start to gently rattle and shake the paper plate and watch how the cookies drift apart when what is underneath them shifts     If North and South America are drifting towards Asia, which ocean would become smaller?

So why do we bother protecting them?&nbsp;Do ancient sites have any value for us?&nbsp;   They connect us to the past   Preserving ancient sites and objects is important when they reflect our cultural, social, economic, political, archaeological, or architectural history. This history is important because it connects us to specific times, places, and events that were significant milestones in our collective past.  Visiting these sites provides us with a sense of place, and maintains continuity between our past and our present. It helps us understand how we arrived at where and who we are today.   Social &amp; cultural benefits   A community benefits when its citizens take pride in its history and share a common desire to preserve and share their unique past. The tangible presence that ancient sites provide enriches the cultural heritage of a place and its people. They help people connect with each other and with the place that they live. It makes them feel part of something that has existed for hundreds or thousands of years.   It expands human knowledge   By studying history, we learn more about who we are and where we've come from. This grows our knowledge about our species and civilisations, which we can use to make better decisions into the future. Knowing how ancient people and societies dealt with issues in the past helps us to recognise those same issues in the present or the future. And if we know how people tried to respond to these problems in the past and what worked (and didn't work), we can use our learnings to make better decisions today.&nbsp;   Economic benefits   Maintaining and saving ancient sites creates a major demand for tourism. Visiting ancient sites provides people from all over the world with an opportunity to enjoy something spectacular and learn about other cultures and their histories.  For this reason, preserving ancient sites can make a big difference to a country's economy. For example, close to 15 million people visit the Pyramids of Giza (in Egypt) every year! Many of these visitors would not visit Egypt if the Pyramids had not been protected and preserved.&nbsp;  Visitors who are there to see ancient sites spend money on accommodation, food and drink, and on other local wares. This creates employment for thousands of people. The act of preserving an ancient site and making it available to the public also creates many jobs for local communities (workers, cleaners, tour guides, security guards, etc).   Name a historical site you have been to, or would like to visit one day. What did you like about it, or why would you like to visit this site?   Provide three reasons for why you think it is great that this site has been preserved   Is there anything you would add to this list? Name one other reason why you think we should preserve ancient sites   What do you think is the most important reason to preserve ancient sites out of the factors you have looked at? Why? "

It's influenced by five main factors:    Latitude . The latitude of a place is its position on Earth relative to the equator. The closer a place is to the equator, the warmer it will be   Altitude .  The  altitude  of a place is its height above sea level. As altitude increases by 100m, the temperature decreases by around 1°C    Ocean temperatures &amp; currents . Shallower oceans, or oceans near the equator, are generally warmer. Deeper oceans and oceans closer to the Poles are cooler. Generally, places found next to a warm ocean will have higher temperatures and wetter climates. Places found next to cool oceans have colder and drier climates   Distance from oceans . Coastal locations tend to be cooler in summer and warmer in winter than inland areas. This is because oceans lose heat less quickly than land, so in winter an ocean will still retain some warmth from the summer sun   Topography (or relief) . The  aspect  of a slope (the direction it faces) affects its temperature. If it faces the sun during the day, it will be warmer than a slope facing away from the sun   The temperate of a place affects its air pressure. This in turn affects how much rainfall it gets and the direction of the prevailing wind in that area. These factors create the weather in a place.

		"task_content" : "Liveability and community    What is community engagement?     Community engagement  (also called public participation) means that people are involved in shaping the community that they live in. If the people who live in a community have a say in what that community should look like and how it should be run, liveability will improve. And by engaging with their community, people also engage with each other.  Community engagement never used to be a problem prior to the growth of larger cities. Indigenous communities - like Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples - developed a strong system to build community prior to European settlement. This community connection was a kinship system that gave people a place in the family and clan, and a sense of order. They would have clear roles and responsibilities in the community based on their totem and birth order.&nbsp;      Aboriginal Kinship: Nations, Clans, and Family Groups      However, community engagement is becoming rarer in our modern world. As many as 75% people don't know their neighbours' names, despite living so close to them for years or decades. This figure is significantly higher than it was in the mid-20th Century. And fewer people are engaging with their community through volunteer work, being a member of a club or association, or being involved in other community events. That's part of the reason why some places have what is being described as a ‘loneliness epidemic.’      How the UK is Fighting the Loneliness Epidemic      &nbsp;    How do you build connected communities?    There's no one way to create happy, connected communities. Any idea which brings people together and makes a city or town feel like it is made by the people within it, rather than the buildings and streets, can achieve this.  The  Happy City  movement emphasises designing cities which maximise the possibility for interactions between its residents. This includes things like more community volunteering and community-run events (like walking tours and workshops); more public-friendly architecture (like markets and squares); and a greater celebration of a city or town's unique heritage or culture.      The Common Factor of Happy Cities      City planners now also think about the  emotional infrastructure  of a place. This means they think of including spaces which allow people to emotionally connect with each other and feel a sense of belonging to and connection with their city.&nbsp;  A good example of this are the town squares in cities across Europe. For centuries, they've been the heartbeat and central meeting point of communities across the continent.      Siena's Piazza del Campo       Read the quote below. Use it to explain how piazzas (town squares) enhance the liveability of towns and cities in Italy   For Italians, the piazza or square, is not just the architectural space that characterizes cities and villages, but an open air, urban living room. It is the heart of each Italian town where history, architecture and social relations become one. The piazza means belonging to a society and it means daily life. In each town, it reunites the two most important buildings, the city hall and the church: the political and the religious power face each other, with people’s daily life, new acquaintances and commercial deals all taking place between them.  The piazza is a space which is not only constituted by architectural arrangements but, more than any other, comes to life thanks to the people who fill it with meaning … The piazza has a meaning that goes well beyond that found in a dictionary: it means even the most lonely people can find someone to talk with. It means that, without spending a single cent in a restaurant or a movie theatre, they can enjoy hours of social life, feel a sense of belonging, learn about births, deaths, marriages and finally go home without that terrible feeling of estrangement and loneliness typical of when we feel alone.

Use it to explain how piazzas (town squares) enhance the liveability of towns and cities in Italy   For Italians, the piazza or square, is not just the architectural space that characterizes cities and villages, but an open air, urban living room. It is the heart of each Italian town where history, architecture and social relations become one. The piazza means belonging to a society and it means daily life. In each town, it reunites the two most important buildings, the city hall and the church: the political and the religious power face each other, with people’s daily life, new acquaintances and commercial deals all taking place between them.  The piazza is a space which is not only constituted by architectural arrangements but, more than any other, comes to life thanks to the people who fill it with meaning … The piazza has a meaning that goes well beyond that found in a dictionary: it means even the most lonely people can find someone to talk with. It means that, without spending a single cent in a restaurant or a movie theatre, they can enjoy hours of social life, feel a sense of belonging, learn about births, deaths, marriages and finally go home without that terrible feeling of estrangement and loneliness typical of when we feel alone.

The smaller particles are drained out of the holes in the sieve whilst the larger particles are caught in the sieve. You could use sieving to (for example) separate a mixture of sand and pebbles.

Separation Techniques - Sieving      &nbsp;    Filtration     Filtration  is used to separate a solid from a liquid or a gas. A filter has extremely small holes which allow a liquid through it but catch even the smallest of solid particles.

So, how do we decide where to direct time, money, and effort when choosing which sites to protect?  &nbsp;    UNESCO world heritage sites    One of the duties of  UNESCO (The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization)  is to identify and protect ancient sites. These are designated as  World Heritage sites . World Heritage sites are places that have outstanding universal value to humanity and, therefore, need to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy.      What are UNESCO World Heritage Sites     ?     Check out the interactive map below that shows all the World Heritage sites. How many have you been to?      Map of World Heritage Sites       What makes a world heritage site?   UNESCO uses 10 different criteria to identify which sites are deserving of protection as World Heritage sites. They are summarised in the image below, but the full explanation of each criteria can be found at the link below.      World Heritage Sites - Selection Criteria          The first six criteria usually apply to historical sites (like the Acropolis in Athens), and the last four criteria usually apply to natural sites (like the Great Barrier Reef in Australia).  Of course, an ancient site doesn't need to be recognised as a World Heritage site to be worthy of protection. There are many ancient sites across the world that haven't been designated a World Heritage site but which are still carefully preserved. But the criteria used for awarding World Heritage status is still a useful guide for us when we decide whether an ancient or historical site should be protected.   How do you think the heritage site fits your criteria?   Do you think your chosen criteria point is the most important? Why or why not?   Does your chosen criteria connect to the reasons to preserve ancient sites that you have explored previously? Why or why not? "

		"task_title" : "Separating oil and water",
		"task_content" : "Separating oil and water    Reversible changes    When two or more substances are mixed together, they can sometimes be separated again into two different substances. This is called a  reversible change .&nbsp;  A reversible change occurs when there is no chemical reaction as a result of mixing two substances together. When we mix salt and water, there is no chemical reaction - so therefore it is an example of a reversible change. This is because we can evaporate the water and then we are left with salt.  We can separate mixtures created by a reversible change. The techniques we can use include sieving, filtering, decanting, or magnetism.&nbsp;  Reversible changes can also occur when the  state  of a single substance changes. For example, you can take a hard block of chocolate and melt it - this changes its state from a solid to a liquid. But we can also freeze that liquid chocolate and it will turn back into a solid. No chemical change has occurred, so we can reverse both the melting and the freezing of chocolate.  &nbsp;    Irreversible changes    When we mix substances and a chemical change occurs - or when a chemical change occurs in a single substance - this will often be an example of an  irreversible change . In these cases, because a chemical change has occurred we can't reverse them.  For example, you can't ‘uncook’ an egg and return it to its raw state. You also can't ‘untoast’ a slice of bread. These changes are irreversible. The ‘cooking’ of both the egg and the bread is a chemical change which causes both substances to be changed in a way that can't be undone.  &nbsp;    Is an oil spill a reversible or irreversible change?    We saw in the last task that, when we mixed oil and water, the oil stayed on top of the water. It did not dissolve like salt or sugar, but it also didn't sink or become suspended in the water like flour or tea.&nbsp;  This is because the molecules that make up oil are different from the molecules that make up water. They don't mix together, so the two substances stay separate.      Why Don't Oil and Water Mix?      So, is mixing oil and water a reversible change? Or, once mixed, can we never separate them again?  &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To use filtering to separate a mixture     Materials         Oil and water mixture (from previous task)    Another glass\/jar or clear plastic cup      Small funnel    Water      Filter paper or coffee filter (to fit funnel)   &nbsp;        Method      Make a cone with your filter paper.

Moisten the filter paper with a little water to make it stick to the sides of the funnel    Place the funnel in the empty glass\/jar or cup    Carefully pour a small amount of the oil and water mixture into the funnel. Try to make sure that&nbsp; you don’t pour too much so that the funnel is overflowing. Also ensure that you don’t pour the mixture down the side between the filter paper and the funnel as it will cause the oil to go through to your container    Leave for two minutes to allow all water to pass through the filter     Could this method of separating oil and water be used to help clean up oil spills?

Predicting offspring traits    In the alien activity in the last task, you used a coin toss to determine the alleles which your alien offspring inherited. But, in the real world, we can predict the likelihood of offspring inheriting certain alleles with greater precision. Using Mendel’s inheritance laws, we can predict the genotype and phenotype of basic genetic crosses.  Before we explore how to do this, we first need to understand how to use  Punnett squares . A Punnett square is a simple tool which helps us identify the possible variations - and the probabilities of each variation - which can occur through reproduction, based on Mendelian inheritance.      Punnett Squares and Mendelian Inheritance      Look at the example below. It shows the alleles from two ‘parent’ flowers. Both parents have one dominant (B) and one recessive (b) allele.      To interpret this:   Each square is a possible option for the alleles which the offspring flower will receive. To fill this in, you take the letter from the top row and pair it with the letter from the left column. Remember that a dominant gene is always capitalised and always is written before a recessive gene in the pairings (e.g. Bb)  We can see that, in the three of the four squares, a dominant gene will be inherited by the offspring flower. This means that there is a ¾ (or 75%) chance that the flower will exhibit the dominant gene (in this case, the colour purple) in their phenotype  In one of the four squares, the offspring flower receives two recessive genes. This means that there is a ¼ (or 25%) chance that the flower will exhibit the recessive gene (the colour white) in their phenotype   Remember that we can determine both an offspring's possible genotype  and  their phenotype by using a Punnett square.   A homozygous cross   Homozygous individuals have two of the same alleles for a particular gene. This might be a dominant gene (e.g. XX) or a recessive gene (xx).  If two parents who both have two dominant genes (XX &amp; XX), the offspring will inherit XX as there is no recessive gene to inherit. The opposite is true for two parents who both have two recessive genes (xx &amp; xx): the offspring must inherit two recessive genes (xx).

A planet needs to have three key features:     It must orbit a star (in our solar system, this is the Sun).    It must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape. A rectangular asteroid is therefore not a planet    It must be big enough that its gravity cleared away any other objects of a similar size near its orbit around the Sun.

Flowering plants are called  angiosperms  (which means ‘hidden seeds’ in Greek). Angiosperms are plants that have flowers, seeds, or fruit that contains seeds.  In angiosperms, flowers contain the plant's sexual reproductive organs and are responsible for the reproduction of the plant. Flowers allow the fertilisation of a plant to occur which, once fertilised, allows a seed to grow. We'll learn more about how plants release or disperse their seeds in the next task.  Most flowers have both male and female reproductive structures. A flower's male reproductive system is called the  stamen . A flower's female reproductive system is called the  carpel .&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Stamen   There are usually multiple stamens in each flower. The stamen includes:   The  anther , which is where pollen (male sex cells or plant sperm) is produced  The  filament , which is a small stalk that supports\/holds the anther    Carpel   There is often only one carpel in each flower. However, when there are multiple carpels fused together in the same flower, this is called a  pistil .  The carpel includes:   The  stigma , which is the site where pollen is deposited. When pollen is deposited on the stigma, this is called  pollination  and means the plant has been fertilised  The  style , which is the large stalk in the centre of the flower. It connects the stigma to the ovary  The  ovary , which produces the eggs (ovules) and the seeds once they form  The  ovules , which are the eggs produced by a plant once fertilisation has occurred      &nbsp;  Though the  petal  and the  sepal  are not part of a flower's male or female reproductive structure, they both play an important role.&nbsp;   The  petals  of a flower are what attracts pollinators to the flower.

Why is it important that the ovules are found where they are?   Why is it important for the seeds to be found within the fruit?   Pollen is usually light, smooth, and easy to get from the anthers. There is often an abundance of pollen, and it can be quite difficult to remove from your fingers. Explain how these traits help ensure that pollen is used to pollinate flowers "

Remember, the plates are underneath the Earth’s surface and we cannot see them.      &nbsp;    Continental drift    These tectonic plates aren't fixed in place. They are moving very slightly each year. They move because of different forces within the Earth - hot or cool currents of  magma  (molten rock) push the plates in different directions.

		"task_content" : "How do Newton’s laws explain concussion in sports?    Sport, head trauma, and CTE    Contact sports have always captivated audiences and drawn athletes wanting to demonstrate their speed, strength, and endurance. However, the excitement of huge tackles and body-on-the-line action obscures a more worrying truth. Contact sports can cause serious and irreversible damage to athletes through multiple head knocks or concussions.  In recent decades, we've become more aware of a disease called  Chronic Trauma Encephalophagy (CTE) . CTE is a progressive dying-off of nerve cells in the brain. Right now, we can only definitively diagnose it through a brain autopsy after death. But CTE's early symptoms include confusion, dizziness, and headaches, which turn into memory loss and a lack of emotional control, which culminate in a loss of motor function and a faster onset of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. There is no treatment or cure.      What is CTE?      In recent decades, we've learnt that CTE is likely caused by repeated trauma to the head. It's found most often in people who have played combat sports (like boxing and MMA) and contact sports (like Australian rules football, American football, and rugby). It's even been found in soccer players who have spent years heading the ball.      Inside the Brain of a Suspected CTE Patient      CTE can occur from seemingly-harmless head knocks (like heading a soccer ball) if it happens often enough over a long period of time. But it's thought that the most damaging head knocks - and the ones most likely to cause CTE - are those causing concussions.      What Happens When You Have a Concussion?       Explain the impact on the brain from head trauma using Newton's first law  Remember that the brain floats inside your skull, suspended within cerebrospinal fluid   We're only just beginning to learn about the causes and devastating impacts of CTE.  How are researchers attempting to develop and validate new scientific knowledge in this field? How will this help us understand how to prevent, diagnose, or better treat CTE?

Sport, head trauma, and CTE    Contact sports have always captivated audiences and drawn athletes wanting to demonstrate their speed, strength, and endurance. However, the excitement of huge tackles and body-on-the-line action obscures a more worrying truth. Contact sports can cause serious and irreversible damage to athletes through multiple head knocks or concussions.  In recent decades, we've become more aware of a disease called  Chronic Trauma Encephalophagy (CTE) . CTE is a progressive dying-off of nerve cells in the brain. Right now, we can only definitively diagnose it through a brain autopsy after death.

		"answer" : "\"After a sudden head impact, the brain accelerates towards - and eventually hits - the opposite side of the skull. However, Newton's third law tells us that the force which the brain imparts on the skull is met with an equal and opposite force from the skull acting upon the brain.Because the brain has a smaller mass than the skull, the brain's acceleration must be greater than the skull's (per Newton's second law). This causes the brain to ricochet off the skull and cannon back in the direction it came from. If the initial force to the head - setting the brain in motion - is strong enough, the brain will bounce off the skull and hit the opposite side of the skull, receiving a second round of trauma on the other side.\"",

		"task_content" : "How do Newton’s laws explain concussion in sports?    Sport, head trauma, and CTE    Contact sports have always captivated audiences and drawn athletes wanting to demonstrate their speed, strength, and endurance. However, the excitement of huge tackles and body-on-the-line action obscures a more worrying truth. Contact sports can cause serious and irreversible damage to athletes through multiple head knocks or concussions.  In recent decades, we've become more aware of a disease called  Chronic Trauma Encephalophagy (CTE) . CTE is a progressive dying-off of nerve cells in the brain. Right now, we can only definitively diagnose it through a brain autopsy after death. But CTE's early symptoms include confusion, dizziness, and headaches, which turn into memory loss and a lack of emotional control, which culminate in a loss of motor function and a faster onset of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. There is no treatment or cure.      What is CTE?      In recent decades, we've learnt that CTE is likely caused by repeated trauma to the head. It's found most often in people who have played combat sports (like boxing and MMA) and contact sports (like Australian rules football, American football, and rugby). It's even been found in soccer players who have spent years heading the ball.      Inside the Brain of a Suspected CTE Patient      CTE can occur from seemingly-harmless head knocks (like heading a soccer ball) if it happens often enough over a long period of time. But it's thought that the most damaging head knocks - and the ones most likely to cause CTE - are those causing concussions.      What Happens When You Have a Concussion?       Explain the impact on the brain from head trauma using Newton's first law  Remember that the brain floats inside your skull, suspended within cerebrospinal fluid   We're only just beginning to learn about the causes and devastating impacts of CTE.  How are researchers attempting to develop and validate new scientific knowledge in this field? How will this help us understand how to prevent, diagnose, or better treat CTE?   In some contact sports (like American football), athletes wear helmets to protect their heads from trauma.  Helmets work by spreading the impact of a head knock over a longer period of time. The hard shell of the helmet and the soft padding inside it absorb some of the impact, meaning that your head's change in motion - caused by the impact - happens less suddenly.

		"task_content" : "What is Newton’s first law of motion?    Forces    You've learnt about forces before. Let's quickly recap some key concepts which you'll need to draw upon across this unit:   A  force  is a  push  or a  pull  applied to one object by another object. This could be something we can see (like the  contact force  of a person pushing a pram) or something we can't see (like the  non-contact force  of an object being attracted by a magnet)  Forces are measured in  Newtons (N) . One newton is the force needed to accelerate one kilogram of mass at the rate of  1 m\/s 2   (metre per second squared) in the direction of the applied force  We can represent a force by drawing an arrow showing the direction the force acts in. The size of the arrow shows us how big the force is. The bigger the arrow, the bigger the force.  Below, 5N of force is being applied to the right of the object        Forces are  balanced  when the forces acting on an object are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, resulting in no change in motion or equilibrium   Unbalanced forces , on the other hand, are unequal or act in different directions. This causes a change in motion by accelerating, decelerating, or changing the direction of an object    What do you think separated your successful attempts at flicking the cardboard away from the stack (without collapsing the coin stack) from your unsuccessful attempts (where the coin stack collapsed)?   Give a real-world example where two or more forces are acting on an object in different directions so that they are perfectly balanced.  What happens to the motion of the object in this instance? How does this illustrate Newton's first law and the principle of inertia?   For the attempt where you  successfully   flicked away the cardboard and kept your stack of fifteen coins standing:     Explain why the cardboard flew out of the stack when you flicked it    Explain why the bottom stack of ten coins remained standing    Explain why the top stack of five coins didn't also fly sideways     For the attempt where you  successfully   flicked away the cardboard and kept your stack of fifteen coins standing:     Explain why the cardboard flew out of the stack when you flicked it    Explain why the bottom stack of ten coins remained standing    Explain why the top stack of five coins didn't also fly sideways     For the attempt where you  successfully   flicked away the cardboard and kept your stack of fifteen coins standing:     Explain why the cardboard flew out of the stack when you flicked it    Explain why the bottom stack of ten coins remained standing    Explain why the top stack of five coins didn't also fly sideways     Create a sketch\/diagram which supports your explanation.

		"task_content" : "How does rust form?    What is rust?     When an iron object is left in damp air (or water) for a considerable time, it gets covered with an orange-brown flaky substance. This is called  rust .&nbsp;    R­ust is the common name for a very common compound,  iron oxide.  Iron oxide eats away at the iron and makes it weaker.    Iron oxide forms when iron combines with oxygen and moisture. This process leads to iron rusting. As the air is about 20% oxygen, iron in the open air will almost always rust.    You might have also heard of rust referred to by another name:  corrosion.  Corrosion is the  chemical reaction  that happens when metals break down over time. This happens due to factors in the environment.

This helps us make sense of a contemporary account whilst also using a later analysis to fill in gaps in our understanding.  In this task, we will look at the democratic process of  ostracising  a citizen from Athens.  Ostracism  was a process where members of society could vote to have a citizen exiled from Athens for 10 years. It was used to make sure tyrants could not control the city, and to stop threats to the State which citizens feared.  Let’s quickly learn a little more about what ostracism was from a  secondary source . This is a secondary source because Plutarch - though an ancient Greek philosopher and historian - was writing about this event at a later time (and not as a witness).   Source 1 (secondary source)    “The method of procedure - to give a general outline - was as follows. Each voter took an ostrakon, wrote on it the name of that citizen whom he wished to remove from the city, and brought it to a place in the agora which was all fenced about with railings. The archons first counted the total number of ostraka cast. For if the voters were less than six thousand, the ostracism was void. Then they separated the names, and the man who had received the most votes they proclaimed banished for ten years, with the right to enjoy the income from his property.\"  Plutarch, Plutarch's Lives, trans. Bernadotte Perrin (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1914), 2.   In this source:     Ostrakon \/ Ostraka (plural ) = small piece(s) of pottery     Agora  = central public space     Archons  = chief members of council     How would your conclusions about ostracism be different if you had only examined Source 1 (a secondary source) and not Source 2 (secondary) &amp; Sources 3 &amp; 4 (primary sources)?

		"task_title" : "Separating oil and water",
		"task_content" : "Separating oil and water    Reversible changes    When two or more substances are mixed together, they can sometimes be separated again into two different substances. This is called a  reversible change .&nbsp;  A reversible change occurs when there is no chemical reaction as a result of mixing two substances together. When we mix salt and water, there is no chemical reaction - so therefore it is an example of a reversible change. This is because we can evaporate the water and then we are left with salt.  We can separate mixtures created by a reversible change. The techniques we can use include sieving, filtering, decanting, or magnetism.&nbsp;  Reversible changes can also occur when the  state  of a single substance changes. For example, you can take a hard block of chocolate and melt it - this changes its state from a solid to a liquid. But we can also freeze that liquid chocolate and it will turn back into a solid. No chemical change has occurred, so we can reverse both the melting and the freezing of chocolate.  &nbsp;    Irreversible changes    When we mix substances and a chemical change occurs - or when a chemical change occurs in a single substance - this will often be an example of an  irreversible change . In these cases, because a chemical change has occurred we can't reverse them.  For example, you can't ‘uncook’ an egg and return it to its raw state. You also can't ‘untoast’ a slice of bread. These changes are irreversible. The ‘cooking’ of both the egg and the bread is a chemical change which causes both substances to be changed in a way that can't be undone.  &nbsp;    Is an oil spill a reversible or irreversible change?    We saw in the last task that, when we mixed oil and water, the oil stayed on top of the water. It did not dissolve like salt or sugar, but it also didn't sink or become suspended in the water like flour or tea.&nbsp;  This is because the molecules that make up oil are different from the molecules that make up water. They don't mix together, so the two substances stay separate.      Why Don't Oil and Water Mix?      So, is mixing oil and water a reversible change? Or, once mixed, can we never separate them again?  &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To use filtering to separate a mixture     Materials         Oil and water mixture (from previous task)    Another glass\/jar or clear plastic cup      Small funnel    Water      Filter paper or coffee filter (to fit funnel)   &nbsp;        Method      Make a cone with your filter paper.

Moisten the filter paper with a little water to make it stick to the sides of the funnel    Place the funnel in the empty glass\/jar or cup    Carefully pour a small amount of the oil and water mixture into the funnel. Try to make sure that&nbsp; you don’t pour too much so that the funnel is overflowing. Also ensure that you don’t pour the mixture down the side between the filter paper and the funnel as it will cause the oil to go through to your container    Leave for two minutes to allow all water to pass through the filter     Could this method of separating oil and water be used to help clean up oil spills?

		"task_title" : "The reproductive system of flowers",
		"task_content" : "The reproductive system of flowers    The reproductive system of flowering plants    To understand the importance of bees, we first need to understand how flowering plants reproduce.  Flowering plants are called  angiosperms  (which means ‘hidden seeds’ in Greek). Angiosperms are plants that have flowers, seeds, or fruit that contains seeds.  In angiosperms, flowers contain the plant's sexual reproductive organs and are responsible for the reproduction of the plant. Flowers allow the fertilisation of a plant to occur which, once fertilised, allows a seed to grow. We'll learn more about how plants release or disperse their seeds in the next task.  Most flowers have both male and female reproductive structures. A flower's male reproductive system is called the  stamen . A flower's female reproductive system is called the  carpel .&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Stamen   There are usually multiple stamens in each flower. The stamen includes:   The  anther , which is where pollen (male sex cells or plant sperm) is produced  The  filament , which is a small stalk that supports\/holds the anther    Carpel   There is often only one carpel in each flower. However, when there are multiple carpels fused together in the same flower, this is called a  pistil .  The carpel includes:   The  stigma , which is the site where pollen is deposited. When pollen is deposited on the stigma, this is called  pollination  and means the plant has been fertilised  The  style , which is the large stalk in the centre of the flower. It connects the stigma to the ovary  The  ovary , which produces the eggs (ovules) and the seeds once they form  The  ovules , which are the eggs produced by a plant once fertilisation has occurred      &nbsp;  Though the  petal  and the  sepal  are not part of a flower's male or female reproductive structure, they both play an important role.&nbsp;   The  petals  of a flower are what attracts pollinators to the flower. More on this below  The  sepal  protects the flower when it is still a bud, opening along with the flower once it is ready to bloom    Draw a labelled diagram of your flower, identifying the male and female reproductive parts. You must include accurate drawings and labels of the following: petal, sepal, stamen, anther, filament, stigma, style, ovary, ovule   Explain the role of coloured petals, fragrance, and sepals in the sexual reproduction of flowering plants   Why is fruit usually sweet and pleasant to eat?   Why is it important that the ovules are found where they are?   Why is it important for the seeds to be found within the fruit?   Pollen is usually light, smooth, and easy to get from the anthers. There is often an abundance of pollen, and it can be quite difficult to remove from your fingers. Explain how these traits help ensure that pollen is used to pollinate flowers "

		"task_content" : "What is Newton’s first law of motion?    Forces    You've learnt about forces before. Let's quickly recap some key concepts which you'll need to draw upon across this unit:   A  force  is a  push  or a  pull  applied to one object by another object. This could be something we can see (like the  contact force  of a person pushing a pram) or something we can't see (like the  non-contact force  of an object being attracted by a magnet)  Forces are measured in  Newtons (N) . One newton is the force needed to accelerate one kilogram of mass at the rate of  1 m\/s 2   (metre per second squared) in the direction of the applied force  We can represent a force by drawing an arrow showing the direction the force acts in. The size of the arrow shows us how big the force is. The bigger the arrow, the bigger the force.  Below, 5N of force is being applied to the right of the object        Forces are  balanced  when the forces acting on an object are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, resulting in no change in motion or equilibrium   Unbalanced forces , on the other hand, are unequal or act in different directions. This causes a change in motion by accelerating, decelerating, or changing the direction of an object    What do you think separated your successful attempts at flicking the cardboard away from the stack (without collapsing the coin stack) from your unsuccessful attempts (where the coin stack collapsed)?   Give a real-world example where two or more forces are acting on an object in different directions so that they are perfectly balanced.  What happens to the motion of the object in this instance? How does this illustrate Newton's first law and the principle of inertia?

		"task_title" : "Why does liveability differ across places?",
		"task_content" : "Why does liveability differ across places?    Spatial variation in liveability    Based on your perceptions of liveability, are cities or country towns more liveable? Where would you prefer to live?  Spatial variation refers to differences in patterns between areas or regions. For example, some suburbs in the same city report higher rates of crime than their neighbouring suburbs. And there is often a difference in education and income levels between people who live in more urban areas and those who live in rural areas.  These spatial variations inevitably lead to differences in liveability within countries and places.  &nbsp;    Why are cities generally more liveable?    Most people choose to live in urban areas due to employment opportunities and access to services. With their large population and greater wealth - due to greater economic activity - urban areas have better access to services such as schools, medical facilities, shopping centres, and recreation facilities.  For example,  Tokyo  (the capital of Japan) is home to over 37 million residents and has thousands of medical centres, convenience stores, and public amenities to cater for them.&nbsp;      Tokyo - City Guide      Due to their large populations but limited land size, urban areas tend to have high and medium  density  housing. This means that lots of people are living in close proximity, generally in high-rise apartments. This is an efficient use of space but it can increase  congestion  (how crowded a place is). High-density living also needs to be balanced by plenty of public spaces so that people don't feel ‘walled in’.      Singapore - Balancing Density &amp; Space      Many people prefer space to density. That's why a city's suburbs tend to grow quickly. Suburbs offer relative proximity to cities but tend to be more affordable and can offer more medium and low density housing. To support suburbs, a city needs excellent public transport and good roads. When this doesn't happen, liveability decreases.      Liveability in the Suburbs      However, this doesn't mean all cities are equally liveable. Whether one city is more liveable than another can depend on many factors - like how well-planned the city is, how wealthy it is, how good the government is, the space available for that city, and how old it is.  &nbsp;    Why are rural areas generally less liveable?    In developed countries, rural areas are far less populated than urban cities. Rural land is usually used for agriculture and, because rural towns generally don't have large economies supporting a diverse range of jobs, they find it harder to attract as many people as cities.  This combination of fewer people and less wealth means rural areas do not have the same access to services - like schools, healthcare, and entertainment venues - as cities.  For example, there are over 200 hospitals in greater Sydney but only 15 for the rest of New South Wales - even though Sydney only takes up 1.5% of NSW's land! This is because it is too expensive to build and run hospitals in rural areas where the populations are small, and it is hard to attract the specialist staff needed to work in them.  In some countries, rural areas are less liveable because of very unequal  wealth distribution . This means that a country's wealth is controlled by the wealthiest and most powerful citizens, who usually live in cities. Either because of neglect or corruption in these countries, regional areas receive limited funding and can't afford the services and facilities that its citizens need.

Instead, he would need to be given a command in Genghis Khan's army, watched closely by Genghis Khan himselfThe powerful Naiman families could be stripped of most of their wealth (but allowed to retain some). They should be given new roles in the ‘middle’ tier of Genghis Khan's new society. This show of clemency buys some loyalty, as does allowing them to retain some of their status and wealth. But removing most of their wealth reduces the risk that they can grow too powerful and seek to overthrow Genghis Khan in the futureThe wealth stripped from the Naiman families could be shared with the Naiman soldiers.

		"task_content" : "How did Genghis Khan unify the Mongols?    Who were the Mongols?     Before we explore how Genghis Khan united the Mongols into a single, powerful empire, we need to explore who the Mongols were.    The  Mongols  were a nomadic, tribal people who lived in present-day Mongolia and southern Russia. They descended from many different nomadic groups - including the  Xiongnu  - who had dominated central Asia since the 5th century BCE.    The climate was cold and dry and the land was mainly open grasslands (which we now call  steppe ); the soil didn't have enough nutrients to grow anything else. Because of this, the Mongols couldn't grow crops. Instead, they lived off the meat, milk, and butter which their herds of goats, sheep, cattle, and yaks provided.      A typical landscape of the Mongolian steppe. The Mongols lived in large circular dwellings lined with animal skins and fur called gers    &nbsp;   They were also skilled hunters; they bred fast, strong horses to help them hunt deer, hare, rabbits, and wolves. They even used  falconry  (using birds of prey for hunting), a technique which some Mongolians still practise today.       Mongolian Falconry      Because crops couldn't be grown, excess food couldn't be stored. This meant there were no Mongol cities or concentrated population centres. Instead, the Mongols were scattered across different tribes, which were themselves scattered across the vast steppes. They moved with the seasons; south - towards modern-day China - when winter froze the northern steppes, then back north again in spring and summer. The different tribes often fought each other for control of the best pastures.     The many different tribes of the Mongol Empire, prior to being unified by Genghis Khan  User Khiruge (2014).

Jamukha favoured and promoted his family, while Temüjin believed in a  meritocracy . He shared the spoils of his conquests among his men and rewarded bravery and skill.      Blood Brothers: Tribal Rivalry       The sources which tell us of the conflict between Temüjin and Jamukha were mostly written after   Temüjin had become   Genghis Khan and conquered Asia. Why, then, should we treat with caution the different ways in which they portray   Temüjin and Jamukha?    It's 1204 CE and Genghis Khan has just defeated the powerful  Naiman  tribe. You're one of his trusted advisors. You know that:   The Naiman ruler - Tayang Khan - has plotted against Genghis Khan for decades. Tayang Khan also has a military-age son (Kuchlug)  The Naiman tribe has significant wealth that Genghis Khan has now won for himself. But this wealth was mainly owned by the powerful Naiman families. Most of the Naiman fighters are very poor  The next-most powerful Naiman family has a daughter of marriageable age. One of Genghis Khan's sons is also of marriageable age and does not yet have a bride   What advice would you give Genghis Khan on what to do with the Naimans? How do you win their loyalthy whilst extinguishing any threat they pose?  For example:   Should Tayang Khan be killed or allowed to live? What about his son?  What about the other powerful Naiman families? Should they be allowed to live? If so, should they keep their wealth or have it stripped completely?  What could you do to win the support and loyalty of the Naiman soldiers?  How could you forge an alliance with any of the remaining powerful Naiman families to win their loyalty and reduce the chance of a rebellion?   Discuss this with your team.

Shiji 110: The Account of the Xiongnu      Which similarities can you identify between the Xiongnu and the Mongols, who emerged over 1000 years later?    Mongol sources suggest that conflict between Temüjin and Jamukha arose from the different ways they treated their followers. Jamukha favoured and promoted his family, while Temüjin believed in a  meritocracy . He shared the spoils of his conquests among his men and rewarded bravery and skill.      Blood Brothers: Tribal Rivalry       The sources which tell us of the conflict between Temüjin and Jamukha were mostly written after   Temüjin had become   Genghis Khan and conquered Asia. Why, then, should we treat with caution the different ways in which they portray   Temüjin and Jamukha?  "

		"task_content" : "Light refraction    What is refraction?     If you have ever tried to run in water, you know that your body slows down and can't move normally. The same thing happens with light when it shines on dense material; it slows down. Not only does it slow down, but the light waves tend to bend in different directions. This bending of light is called  refraction .       How Refraction Occurs       You might have noticed this bending of light before when you see objects in water. Where the object meets the water, it looks out of place. This bending of the light happens at the point where air meets water.        Why does refraction occur?     When light moves from the less dense air to a ‘heavier’ - or more dense - environment, the light ray slows down as it can't pass through the object as quickly.   Light travels slowly through glass, a bit faster through water, and fastest through air. When using our glass of water example, this means that the light bends once when it travels through the glass cup into the water, and then it bends again when it travels out of the glass cup and into the air.&nbsp;   &nbsp;    Experiment      Aim     To observe how the refraction of light affects an image     Materials         1 x A4 paper    Glass      Texta\/marker    Water         Method      On the piece of paper, use the marker to draw two arrows on it.

Why do you think that light travels slowly through glass and faster through air? "
